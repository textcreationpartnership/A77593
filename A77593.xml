            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Mary pondered the ſayings of the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheards in her heart,</hi> Luke 2. 19. Not they that eat moſt, but they that digeſt moſt, are

            <p>Alaſſe! what can Chriſts Sword, Chriſts word doe without his arm? Therefore look up to Chriſts arme in prayer, that ſo his Sword, his word, may doe great things in your ſoules.</p>

            <p>In the Greek, or <hi>was this Grace given.</hi> The word that's here rendred <hi>Grace,</hi> is taken in Scripture, not onely for the <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God,</hi> but alſo for his <hi>Gratious gifts;</hi> and ſo you are to underſtand it in this place: Grace is taken for the gifts of Grace, and they are two-fold: Common; or Speciall. Some are Common to Believers and Hypocrites; as knowledge, tongues, a gift of prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some are Speciall and peculiar to the Saints, as feare, love, faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now <hi>Paul</hi> had all theſe, the better to fit him for that high and noble Service to which he was call'd.
<q>That I ſhould Preach.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That is, declare good newes, or glad tidings. The Greek word anſwers to the Hebrew word which ſignifies <hi>good newes, glad tidings,</hi> and <hi>a Joyful Meſſage.</hi>
               <q>That I ſhould Preach among the Gentiles.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes this Greek word is generally uſed for all men, or for all Nations. Sometimes the word is uſed more eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the people of the <hi>Jewes.</hi> Sometimes 'tis uſed for the <hi>Gentiles</hi> diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>Jewes,</hi> ſo 'tis uſed, <hi>Mat. 6. 32. For after all theſe things doe the Gentiles ſeeke;</hi> and ſo 'tis uſed here; thoſe that are without God in the world, that ſtand in Armes againſt God, that are ignorant of thoſe riches of Grace that are in Chriſt: This Grace is given to me, that I ſhould preach among the poore Heathens, <hi>the unſearchable riches of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That I might Preach among the Gentiles.</hi> What? my ſelfe? No, but
<q>The unſearchable riches of Chriſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Greek word ſignifies, <hi>Not to be traced out.</hi> Here's Rhetorick indeed! here's riches, unſearchable riches, unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able riches of Chriſt. Riches alwayes imply two things. Firſt, Abundance. Secondly, Abundance of ſuch things as be of worth.

            <p>See it in <hi>Job;</hi> no man ever received a fairer, or a more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Certificate under the hand of God, or the broad Seale of Heaven, for his being a ſoule famous in grace and holineſſe, then <hi>Job;</hi> as you may ſee, <hi>Job 1. 8. And the Lord ſaid unto</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:168177:15"/> 
               <hi>Satan, haſt thou conſidered my Servant Job, that there is none like him in the Earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and eſcheweth evill.</hi> And yet no man could ſpeak more undervaluingly of himſelfe, then <hi>Job</hi> did, <hi>Job 42. 5, 6. I have heard of thee by the hearing of the eare, but now mine eye ſeeth thee, I abhor my ſelfe in duſt and aſhes.</hi> This expreſſion, is the deepeſt act of abhorrency. Abhorrency ſtrictly taken, is hatred wound up to the height. <hi>I abhor my ſelfe,</hi> the word that's rendred <hi>Abhor,</hi> ſignifies to reject, to diſdaine, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne, and to caſt off. Ah ſayes <hi>Job,</hi> I abhor my ſelfe, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject my ſelfe, I diſdaine my ſelfe, I caſt off my ſelfe, I have a vile eſteem of my ſelfe. So our bleſſed Apoſtle, who had been caught up into the third Heavens, and had ſuch glorious Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations as could not be uttered; yet he accounted himſelfe <hi>leſſe then the leaſt of all Saints.</hi> Not that any thing can be leſſe then the leaſt, the Apoſtles holy Rhetorick doth not croſſe <hi>Ariſtotle's</hi> Philoſophy; but the Originall word being a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diminitive, his meaning is, that he was as little as could be; therefore he put himſelfe downe ſo little, as could not be leſſe then the leaſt.</p>
            <p>Another proof you have, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. 1, 5, 6. As <hi>Paul</hi> among the Apoſtles was the greateſt; ſo <hi>Eſay</hi> among the Prophets was the cleareſt and choyceſt Goſpel-Preacher, and holds out more of Chriſt, and of his Kingdome and glory, then all the other Prophets doe. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. 1. he ſees the glory of the Lord in a Viſion, and this makes him cry out, <hi>verſ. 5. Wee is me, for I am undone, becauſe I am a man of uncleane lips, and I dwell in the midſt of a people of uncleane lips, for mine eyes have ſeene the King, the Lord of Hoſts. I am undone,</hi> the Hebrew is, <hi>I am cut off,</hi> I am a forlorne man, why? <hi>For I have ſeen the King, the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> Here you have the higheſt and choy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt among the Prophets (as you had <hi>Paul</hi> before among the Apoſtles) abaſing and laying low himſelfe.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Peter,</hi> Luke 5. 8. <hi>Depart from me, for I am a ſinfull man, O Lord.</hi> When he ſaw that glorious Miracle wrought by the Lord Jeſus, he cryes out as one very ſenſible of his owne weakneſſe and ſinfullneſſe, <hi>Depart from me, for I am a ſinfull man.</hi> Ah I am not worthy to be neer ſuch Majeſty and

               </note> 
               <hi>and ſaid, Behold I have taken upon me to ſpeake unto the Lord, who am but duſt and aſhes.</hi> Here you have the Father of the Faithfull, the greateſt Believer in the world, accounting himſelfe duſt and aſhes. Duſt notes the baſeneſſe of his Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, and Aſhes notes his deſerving to be burnt to aſhes, if God ſhould deale with him in juſtice, rather then in mercy. The nearer any ſoule drawes to God, the more humble will that ſoule lye before God. None ſo neere God as the Angels, nor none ſo humble before God, as the Angels.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 32. 10. <hi>I am not worthy of the leaſt of all the mercies, and all the truth which thou haſt ſhewed unto thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Jacob</hi> a man eminent in his prevailing with God, a Prince that had the honour and the happineſſe to overcome the God of mercy, yet judges himſelfe unworthy of the leaſt mercy. Ah, how low is that ſoule in his owne eyes, that is moſt honourable in Gods eyes?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> you know was a man after Gods owne heart, a man highly honoured, much beloved, and dearly prized by the

A Worme is the moſt deſpicable Creature in the world, trampled under foot by every one. Sayes he, I am a deſpicable worme in my owne eyes, and in my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies eyes.</p>
            <p>And thus you ſee the point proved, that <hi>the moſt holy men have been alwayes the moſt humble men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond thing that I am to doe, is, To ſhew you the Properties of humble ſoules. I confeſſe, when I look abroad in the world, and obſerve the carriage of all ſorts of men, my heart is ſtirr'd to ſpeak as fully and as home to this point, as Chriſt ſhall help me. 'Tis very, very ſad to conſider, how few humble ſoules there be in theſe dayes: Ah, the damnable
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:168177:16"/> pride that reignes and rules in the hearts &amp; lives of moſt men;

            <p>Now the firſt property that I ſhall lay downe of an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſoule, is this, <hi>An humble ſoule under the higheſt ſpirituall diſcoveries, and under the greateſt outward mercies, forgets not his former ſinfullneſſe, and his former outward meanneſſe. Paul</hi>

So <hi>Rom. 7. 23. I ſee a Law in my members warring againſt the Law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the Law of ſin, which is in my members.</hi> He had been at this time about fourteene yeares converted, as ſome judge. He was a man that lived at as high a rate in God, as any we read of, a man that was filled with glorious diſcoveries and revelations, and yet under all diſcoveries and revelations, he remembers that body of ſin and death, that made him cry out, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me?</hi> Who ſhall eaſe me of my burden? who ſhall knock off theſe Chaines that make my life a hell? I will by a few inſtances prove the other branch, <hi>Gen. 32. 10.

Under his outward greatneſſe he forgets not his former meanneſſe. An humble ſoule is good at looking back upon his former low eſtate, upon his thred-bare Coat that was his beſt and onely Robe.</p>

David</hi> remembred the meanneſſe of his birth, he remembred his She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheards Crook, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did his Travelling Staffe. Mercies make an humble ſoule glad, but not proud. An humble ſoule is loweſt, when his mercies are higheſt, he is leaſt when he is greateſt, he is loweſt when he is higheſt, he is moſt poor, when he is moſt rich: Nothing melts like mercy, nothing drawes like mercy, nothing humbles like mercy; mercy gives the humble ſoule ſuch excellent Counſell, as <hi>Plaſilla</hi> the Empreſs gave her Husband <hi>Theodoſius, Remember Oh Husband</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>what lately you were, and what now you are, ſo ſhall you Governe well the Empire, and give God his due praiſe for ſo great an advancement.</hi> The voyce of mercy is, Remember what lately thou wert, and what now thou art, and be humble. Now proud men that are lifted up from the dunghill, that abound in worldly wealth, ah how do's their blood riſe with their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward good, the more mercies they have, the more proud they are; mercies doe but puffe and ſwell ſuch ſoules; in a croud of mercies, they cry out in the pride of their hearts, <hi>Depart from us, O God, for we deſire not the knowledge of thy wayes.

               <hi>an humble ſoule.</hi> An humble <hi>David</hi> will dance before the Ark, he enjoyed ſo much of God in it, that it cauſed him to leap and dance before it: but <hi>Michal</hi> his wife deſpiſed him for a foole, and counted him as a ſimple vaine fellow, looking upon his carriage as vaine and light, and not becoming the might, Majeſty, and glory, of ſo glorious a Prince. Well ſayes this humble ſoule, if this be to be vile, I will be more vile.</p>
            <p>Great <hi>Paul,</hi> yet being humble and low in his owne eyes, he can ſtoop to doe ſervice to the leaſt and the meaneſt Saint.</p>
            <p>1 Cor. 9. 19, 20, 21. <hi>For though I be free from all men, yet have I made my ſelfe ſervant unto all, that I might gaine the more: And unto the Jewes I became as a Jew, that I might gaine the Jewes: To them that are under the Law, as under the Law, that I might gaine them that are under the Law: To them that are without Law, as without Law, (being not without Law to God, but under the Law to Chriſt) that I might gaine them that are without Law. To the weake became I as weake, that I might gaine the weake. I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means gaine ſome.</hi> Here you have an humble ſoule bowing and ſtooping to the meaneſt Saints, and the loweſt ſervices, that he might win ſoules. So the Lord Jeſus himſelfe was famous in this, <hi>John</hi> 13. 4. Though he was the Lord of glory, and one that thought it no robbery to be equall with God, one that had all perfection and fullneſſe in himſelfe, yet the loweſt work is not below this King of Kings, witneſſe his waſhing his Diſciples feet, and wiping them with a Towell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> though he was born of great Parentage, and a great Scholler, yet, to keep his mind from ſwelling, he would often ſweep rooms, waſh veſſels, and make beds.</p>
            <p>So that famous Italian Marqueſs, when God was pleaſed by the Miniſtry of his word to convert him, the loweſt work was not below him; though he might have liv'd like a King in his owne Countrey, yet having taſted of that life and ſweet that was in Jeſus, he was ſo humble that he would goe to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, and carry home the meaneſt and the pooreſt things the Market yielded. There was nothing below him when God had chang'd him, and humbled him.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:168177:18"/>
            <p>'Tis recorded to the glory of ſome antient Generalls, that they were able to call every common Souldier by his owne name, and were carefull to provide money, not onely for their Captaines and Souldiers, but litter alſo for the meaneſt Beaſt. There is not the loweſt good that is below the humble ſoule. If the work be good, though never ſo low, humility will put a hand to it; ſo will not pride.</p>
            <p>A fourth Property of an humbled heart is this, <hi>An humble heart will ſubmit to every truth of God, that is made knowne to it; even to thoſe Divine truths that are moſt croſſe to fleſh and blood.</hi> 1 Sam. 3. 17. <hi>Eli</hi> would faine know what God had diſcovered to <hi>Samuel</hi> concerning him; <hi>Samuel</hi> tells him, that he muſt break his neck, that the Prieſthood muſt be taken away from him, and his Sons muſt be ſlaine in the warre: why <hi>it is the Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>let him doe what ſeemeth him good.</hi> So in <hi>Levit.</hi> 10. the Lord by fire from Heaven deſtroyes <hi>Aarons</hi> two Sons, <hi>Then Moſes ſaid unto Aaron, this is it that the Lord ſpake, ſaying, I will be ſanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified; and Aaron held his peace.</hi> If God miſſe of his honour one way, he will raine hell out of Heaven, but he will have it another way; this <hi>Aaron</hi> knew, and therefore he held his peace, when God ſhewed himſelfe to be a conſuming fire. The Hebrew word that is here rendred <hi>Peace,</hi> ſignifies the quietneſſe and ſilence of his mind, he did not hold his tongue onely (for many a man may hold his tongue, and yet his mind and heart may kick and ſwell againſt God) but his very mind was quiet and ſtill; there was a heavenly calme in his Spirit, he was dumb and ſilent becauſe the Lord had done it. So in <hi>Acts 10. 33. We are all here preſent before God, to heare all things that are commanded thee of God.</hi> We are not here to heare what may tickle our eares, or pleaſe our fanſies, or ſatisfie our luſts; no, but we are here to hear what God will ſay, our hearts ſtand ready preſſed to ſubject themſelves to whatever God ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to be his will; we are willing to heare that we may doe, that we may obey ſincerely and univerſally the good pleaſure of our God, knowing that 'tis as well our dignity as our duty ſo to doe.</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:168177:18"/>
            <p>There are three things in an humble ſoule that doe ſtrongly incline it to duty.</p>
            <list>
               <item>The firſt is <hi>Divine Love.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>The ſecond is <hi>Divine Preſence.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>The third is <hi>Divine Glory.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>The Dove made uſe of her wings to fly to the Ark, ſo does an humble ſoule of his duties to fly to Chriſt. Though the Dove did uſe her wings, yet ſhe did not truſt in her wings, but in the Ark: So though an humble ſoule does uſe duties, yet he does not truſt in his duties, but in his Jeſus. But now proud hearts they hate the truth, they cry out, <hi>Who is the Lord that we ſhould obey him? And what are his Commandements that we ſhould ſubmit to them?</hi> I but an humble ſoule falls under the power of truth, and counts it his greateſt glory to be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to all truth.</p>
            <p>A fifth property of an humble ſoule is this, <hi>An humble ſoule lives not upon himſelfe, nor upon his owne actings, but upon the Lord Jeſus, and his actings.</hi> Poore men, you know, they doe not live upon themſelves, they live upon others, they live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the care of others, the love of others, the proviſion of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; why, thus an humble ſoule lives upon the care of Chriſt, the love of Chriſt, the promiſe of Chriſt, the faithfulneſſe of Chriſt, the diſcoveries of Chriſt; he lives upon Chriſt for his Juſtification, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. from <hi>ver.</hi> 7. to 10—He lives upon Chriſt for his Sanctification, <hi>Cant. 4. 16. Awake O North winde, and come thou South, blow upon my Garden that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof may flow out—</hi> And he lives upon Chriſt for his Conſolation, <hi>Cant 2. 3. As the Apple-tree among the trees of the wood, ſo is my beloved among the Sons. I ſate downe under his ſhaddow with great delight, and his fruit was ſweet to my taſt—</hi> And he lives upon Chriſt for the performance of all holy actions, <hi>Phil. 4. 13. I can doe all things through Chriſt which ſtrengtheneth me.</hi> Gal. 2. 20. <hi>I live, yet not I but Chriſt lives in me, and the life which I now live in the fleſh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himſelfe for me.</hi> An humble ſoule ſees in Chriſt
<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Plenitudo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undantiae,</hi> and <hi>plenitudo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dandantiae. Omne bonum in ſummo bono.</hi> All good is in the chiefeſt good. Chriſt is <hi>quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid appetibile,</hi> as <hi>Origen</hi> ſpeaks, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we can deſire. <hi>Iſa. 58. 2. 7. Luke 7. 4, 5, 6, 7. 6 Property.</hi> A proud heart reſiſts, and is reſiſted, this is <hi>duro durum,</hi> flint to flint, fire to fire. <hi>Job</hi> 13. 25. An humble ſoule bleſſes God as well for croſſes, as mercies; as well for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity as for proſperity, as well for frowns, as for ſmiles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe he judges him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unworthy of the leaſt rebukes from God.</note> a fullneſſe of Abundance, and a fullneſſe of redundancy, and here his ſoul lives and feeds. An humble ſoul ſees that all his ſtock is in the hands of Chriſt;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:168177:19"/> his ſtock of Graces, his ſtock of Comforts, his ſtock of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are in the hands of Jeſus Chriſt, who is the <hi>Great Lord Keeper</hi> of all a Believers Graces, and of all his Comforts, and therefore as Children live upon them in whoſe hand their ſtock is, be it a Brother or a Friend: Why, ſo an humble ſoule, ſees its ſtock is in the hand of the Lord Jeſus, and therefore he lives upon Chriſt, upon his love, and his proviſion, and his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But now proud hearts live not upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, they live upon themſelves, and upon their owne duties, their owne righteouſneſſe, their owne actings, as the Scripture evidences. Chriſt dwells in that heart moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently, that hath emptied it ſelfe of it ſelfe. Chriſt is the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mans <hi>Manna,</hi> upon which he lives, and by which he thrives.</p>
            <p>A ſixth Property of an humble ſoule is this, <hi>He judges him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be below the wrath and judgements of God.</hi> An humble ſoule looks upon himſelfe as one not worthy that God ſhould ſpend a rodd upon him, in order to his reformation, edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or ſalvation. As I am unworthy, ſaith an humble ſoule, that God ſhould ſmile upon me, ſo I am unworthy that he ſhould ſpend a frowne upon me. <hi>Job 13. 25. Wilt thou break a leafe driven too and fro? and wilt thou purſue the dry ſtubble?</hi> Why I am but a leaf, I am but a little dry ſtubble, I am below thy wrath, I am ſo very, very bad, that I wonder that thou ſhouldſt ſo much as ſpend a rod upon me. What more weak, worthleſſe, ſlight, and contemptible then a leafe? then dry ſtubble? why Lord, ſayes <hi>Job,</hi> I am a poor, weak, and worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Creature, I wonder that thou ſhouldſt take any paines to doe me good, I can't but count and call every thing a mercy that is leſſe then hell.</p>
            <p>So <hi>David,</hi> in 1 <hi>Sam. 24. 14. After whom is the King of Iſrael come out? after whom doſt thou purſue? after a dead Dogg, after a Flea.</hi> The language of a humble ſoule when God begins to be angry, is this, Lord I can bleſſe thee that thou wilt take any paines with me; but I humbly acknowledge that I am below the leaſt rodd, I am not worthy that thou ſhouldſt frowne upon me, threaten me, ſtrike me, or whip me, for my internall and eternall good. But proud hearts think
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:168177:19"/> themſelves wronged when they are afflicted, they cry out with <hi>Cain, Our puniſhment is greater then we can beare.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 4. 13. 7 Property.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Another Property of an humble ſoule is this, <hi>An humble ſoule doth highly prize the leaſt of Chriſt.</hi> The leaſt ſmile, the leaſt good word, the leaſt good look, the leaſt truth, the leaſt mercy is highly valued by an humble ſoule.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cananitiſh</hi> woman in the 15 of <hi>Matthew,</hi> ſets a high

If I may not have Sun-light, let me have Moon-light? if not Moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, let me have ſtar-light? if not ſtar-light, let me have can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-light? and for that I will bleſſe thee.</p>
            <p>In the time of the Law, the meaneſt things that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated, were very highly prized, as <hi>leather,</hi> or <hi>wood</hi> that was in the Tabernacle. An humble ſoule looks upon all the things of God as Conſecrated things. Every truth of God is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated truth, 'tis conſecrated to a holy uſe, and this cauſes the ſoule highly to prize it; and ſo every ſmile of God, and every diſcovery of God, and every drop of mercy from God, is very highly priſed by a ſoule that walks humbly with God. The name of Chriſt, the voyce of Chriſt, the foot-ſteps of Chriſt, the leaſt touch of the Garment of Chriſt, the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded truth of Chriſt, the meaneſt and leaſt regarded among the flock of Chriſt, is highly prized by humble ſoules that are intereſted in Chriſt. An humble ſoule cannot, an humble ſoul dares not call any thing litrle that ha's Chriſt in it; neither can an humble ſoule call or count any thing great, wherein he ſees not Chriſt, wherein he enjoyes not Chriſt. An humble ſoule highly prizes the leaſt nodd, the leaſt love-token, the leaſt courteſie from Chriſt; but proud hearts count great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſmall mercies, and ſmall mercies, no mercies; yea pride do's ſo unman them, that they often call mercy, miſery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The eighth Property of an humble ſoule is this, <hi>It can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be good enough;</hi> it can never pray enough, nor hear enough, nor mourne enough, nor believe enough, nor love enough, nor feare enough, nor joy enough, nor repent enough, nor loath ſin enough, nor be humble enough, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>No holineſſe below that matchleſſe, peerleſſe, ſpotleſſe, perfect holineſſe that Saints ſhall have in the glorious day of Chriſts appearing, will ſatisfie this humble ſoule. An humble heart is an aſpiring heart, he can't be contented to get up ſome rounds in <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ladder, but he muſt get to the very top of the Ladder, to the very top of holineſſe. An humble heart can't be ſatisfied with ſo much Grace as will bring him to glory, with ſo much of Heaven as will keep him from dropping into Hell, he is ſtill a crying out, Give Lord give, give me more of thy ſelfe, more of thy Son, more of thy Spirit, give me more light, more life, more love, <hi>&amp;c.

The Hebrew word ſignifies to ſmite, wound, or chaſtize. Ah! his heart ſtruck him, his heart chaſtiſed him, his heart wounded him for cutting off <hi>Sauls</hi> ſkirt, though he did it upon noble grounds, <hi>viz.</hi> to convince <hi>Saul</hi> of his falſe jealouſies, and to evidence his owne innocency and integrity. And ſo, at another time, his heart ſmote him for numbring the people, as if he had murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the people, 2 <hi>Sam. 24. 10. And Davids heart ſmote him, after that he had numbred the people; and David ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, I have ſinned greatly in that I have done: And now I beſeech thee, O Lord, take away the iniquity of thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, for I have done very fooliſhly.</hi> An humble ſoule knowes that little ſins (if I may ſo call any) coſt Chriſt his blood, and that they make way for greater; and that little ſins multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied become great, as a little ſum multiplied is great; that they cloud the face of God, wound conſcience, grieve the ſpirit, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce Satan, and make work for Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> An hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſoule knows that little ſins (ſuppoſe them ſo) are very dangerous; a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump; a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſtaffe may kill one, a little poyſon may poyſon one, a little leak in a ſhip, ſinkes it; a little Flye in the box of Ointment ſpoyles it; a little flaw in a good cauſe, marres it: So a little ſin may at once barre the door of Heaven, and open the gates of Hell; and therefore an humble ſoule ſmites and ſtrikes it ſelfe for the leaſt, as well as the greateſt. Though a head of Garlike be little, yet it will poyſon the <hi>Leopard,</hi> though he be great. Though a <hi>Mouſe</hi> is but little, yet it will kill an <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,</hi> if he gets up into his Trunk. Though the <hi>Scorpion</hi> be

            <p>A proud heart counts great ſins ſmall, and ſmall ſins no ſins, and ſo diſarmes Conſcience (for a time) of its whipping and wounding power; but at death, or in Hell, conſcience will take up an iron rod, with which it will laſh the ſinner for ever; and then, though too late, the ſinner ſhall acknowledge his little ſins to be very great, and his great ſins to be exceeding grievous and odious, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

An humble ſoule is a mute ſoule, a tongue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied ſoule, when he looks through ſecondary cauſes, to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream cauſe. So <hi>Aaron,</hi> when he ſaw his Sons ſuddenly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed by a dreadfull and dolefull death, he held his peace, he bridled his paſſions, he ſits ſilent under a terrible ſtroke of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice, becauſe the fire that devoured them, went out from the Lord. So when <hi>Samuel</hi> had told <hi>Eli,</hi> that God would judge his houſe for ever, and that he had ſworn that the iniquity of his houſe ſhould not be purged with ſacrifice, nor offering for ever, <hi>&amp;c. It is the Lord</hi> (ſayes <hi>Eli) let him doe what ſeemeth him good.

            <p>An humble ſoule may groan under afflictions, but he will not grumble in calmes. Proud hearts diſcourſe of patience, but in ſtormes humble hearts exerciſe patience.

As a poore man lives and deales upon the credites of others; ſo does an humble ſoule, live and deale with God, for the ſtrengthening of every grace, and for the ſupply of every mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, upon the credit of the Lord Jeſus. An humble ſoul knows, that ſince he broke with God in Innocency, God will truſt him no more, he will take his word no more; and therefore when he goes to God for mercy, he brings his <hi>Benjamin,</hi> his Jeſus in his armes, and pleads for mercy upon the account of Jeſus.

In the 6, 7, 8 <hi>verſes,</hi> he tels you of the mercies he had received from God, and in the 12 &amp; 13 <hi>verſes,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>What ſhall I render to the Lord, for all his benefits towards me?</hi> I ſee my ſelfe (ſaith he) wonderfully indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; well, what then? why, <hi>I will take the cup of ſalvation, and call upon the name of the Lord; I will pay my vowes unto the Lord, in the preſence of all his people,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>So <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 103. 1, 2, 3, 4. caſts his eyes upon his temporall, and his ſpirituall mercies, and then cals upon his ſoule, <hi>O my ſoule bleſſe the Lord, and all that is within me, bleſſe his holy name. Bleſſe the Lord, O my ſoule, and forget not all his benefits. Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all thy diſeaſes,</hi> &amp;c. An humble ſoule knowes, that 'tis a ſtrange folly to be proud of being more in debt, then another. 'Tis true, ſaith he, I have this and that mercy, in poſſeſſion; and ſuch and ſuch mercies, in reverſion; but by all, I am the more a debtor to God.</p>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:168177:27"/> for mercies (as many are) and yet ſleep ſo quietly, and be ſo mindleſſe, and careleſſe, in bleſſing and praiſing of God. <hi>There is nothing</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>that endures ſo ſmall a time, as the memory of mercies received;</hi> and the more great they are, the more commonly they are recompenced with ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>

            <p>The fifth Conſideration to provoke us to be humble, is
<note place="margin">5 Motive.</note> this, <hi>Let us have alwayes our eye fixed upon the example of Jeſus Chriſt, and his humble and lowly carriage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſt by his owne example labours to provoke his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to keep humble, and to walk lowly, in <hi>John 13. 4, 5, 12, 13, 14, 15 verſes</hi> compared: He rifes and waſhes his Diſciples feet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and mark what he aimes at in that carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of his, <hi>verſ. 12, 13, 14. Know ye what I have done unto you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Yee call me Maſter, and Lord, and yee ſay well, for ſo I am; if I then your Lord and Maſter, have wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed your feet, yee alſo ought to waſh one anothers feet; for I have given you an example, that you ſhould doe as I have done to you.</hi> I have given you an example, ſaith Chriſt, and I would have you to imitate my example. Example is the moſt powerfull Rhetorick; the higheſt and nobleſt example ſhould be very quickning, and provoking. Oh here you have the greateſt, the nobleſt example of humility, that was ever read or heard of: Upon conſideration of this great and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent example of Chriſts humility, <hi>Guericus,</hi> a good man, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, <hi>Thou haſt overcome me, O Lord, thou haſt overcome my pride, this example of thine hath maſtered me.</hi> Oh that we could ſay with this good man, Thou haſt overcome, O Lord, thou haſt overcome our proud hearts, by this example thou haſt over-maſtered our lofty ſpirits.</p>
            <p>This example of Chriſts humility, you have further ſet forth, <hi>Phil. 2. 6, 7, 8. Who being in the forme of God</hi> (that is, in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:168177:31"/> the Nature and Eſſence of God, being very God, cloathed with Divine glory and Majeſty, as God) <hi>thought it not rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery</hi> (it being his right by Nature) <hi>to be equall with God.</hi> The Greek words that are rendred, <hi>He thought it no robbery,</hi> doe import, He made it not a matter of Triumph, or oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be equall with God, it being his right by nature; and therefore the challenging of it, could be no Uſurpation of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers right; of taking to himſelfe that which was not his owne. <hi>He thought it no robbery to be equall with God.</hi> The Greek is <hi>Equalls,</hi> that is, every way equall: not a Secondary and inferiour God, as the <hi>Arrians</hi> would have him. <hi>But made himſelfe of no reputation:</hi> The Greek is, <hi>Emptied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 7.</note> that is, he ſuſpended and laid aſide his glory and Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, or diſ-robed himſelfe of his glory and dignity, and became a ſinner, both by <hi>Imputation,</hi> and by <hi>Reputation,</hi> for our ſakes.</p>
            <p>And <hi>verſ. 8. He humbled himſelfe.</hi> This Son of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe went ten degrees back in the Diall of his Father, that he might come to us with healing under his wings. <hi>And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came obedient unto death, even the death of the croſſe.</hi> In theſe words there is a kind of gradation; for it is more to become <hi>obedient,</hi> then to <hi>humble himſelfe;</hi> and more to <hi>yeeld unto death,</hi> then to become <hi>obedient;</hi> and yet more to be <hi>crucified,</hi> then <hi>ſimply to dye;</hi> for it was to ſubmit himſelfe to a moſt painfull, ignominious, and curſed death. <hi>He became obedient,</hi> that is, ſaith <hi>Beza,</hi> To his dying day, his whole life being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a continuall death.</p>
            <p>I have read of an Earl called <hi>Eleazarus,</hi> that being given to immoderate anger, was cured of that diſordered affection, by ſtudying of Chriſt, and his patience; he ſtill dwelt upon the meditation of Chriſt, and his patience, till he found his heart transformed into the ſimilitude of Jeſus Chriſt. And oh that you would never leave pondering upon that glorious example of Chriſts Humility, till your hearts be made humble, like the heart of Chriſt! Oh that that ſweet word of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 29. might ſtick upon all your hearts! <hi>Take my yoke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, and learne of me, for I am meek and lowly, and you ſhall find reſt to your ſoules.</hi>

               <note place="margin">6 Motive.</note>
            </p>
            <p>When there are never ſuch great ſtormes without, humility will cauſe a calme within. There are a great many ſtormes abroad, and there's nothing will put the ſoule into a quiet condition, but Humility. An humble ſoule ſaith, who am I, that I may not be deſpiſed? Who am I, that I may not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, abuſed, ſlighted, neglected? That which will break a <hi>proud</hi> mans <hi>heart,</hi> will not ſo much as break an <hi>humble</hi> mans <hi>ſleep.</hi> In the midſt of a ſtorme, an humble ſoule is ſtill in a calme: When proud hearts are at their wits ends, ſtamping, ſwearing, and ſwaggering at God, and man, and providence, an humble ſoule is quiet, and ſtill, like a ſhip in a Harbour. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 6. to 13. <hi>Shimei</hi> comes rayling and curſing of <hi>David,</hi> and calls him a bloudy man, and a man of <hi>Belial,</hi> that is, a <hi>Runnagado,</hi> one who being deſperately wicked, had ſhaken off the yoke of Government, and would be under no Law: So the Hebrew word <hi>(Jagnal)</hi> ſignifies, men without yoke, or lawleſſe: Therefore the Septuagint commonly Tranſlate it <hi>(Paranomos) altogether irregular.</hi> It ſignifies moſt fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitious men, and notorious and deſperately wicked, ſtigmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed Villaines, even incarnate Devis; and yet <hi>David</hi> holds his peace, though provoked by his mighty men to revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.

            </p>
            <p>He that is moſt humble, is, and ſhall be moſt exalted, and moſt honoured. No way to be high, like this of being low: <hi>Moſes</hi> was the meekeſt man on Earth, and God made him the honourableſt, calling of him up unto himſelfe into the Mount, making knowne his glory to him, and making of him the Leader of his people <hi>Iſrael.

As the loweſt ſhrubs are freed from many violent guſts and blaſts of wind, which ſhake and rend the talleſt Cedars: So the humble ſoule is free from a world of temptations, that proud and lofty ſoules are ſhaken and torne in pieces with. The Devil hath leaſt power to faſten a temptation upon an humble ſoule. He that hath a gratious meaſure of Humility, is neither affected with Satans proffers, nor terrified with Satans threatniugs. The golden Chaine does not allure him, nor the iron Chaine does not daunt him.</p>
            <p>I have read of one, who ſeeing in a Viſion many ſnares of Satan ſpread upon the earth; he ſate downe, and mourned,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Quis pertran ſiet iſta.</hi> The anſwer was, <hi>Humilitas per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranſiet.</hi>
               </note> and ſaid with himſelfe, <hi>Who ſhall paſſe through theſe?</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he heard a voyce anſwering, <hi>Humility ſhall paſſe through them.</hi> A proud heart is as eaſily conquered, as tempted; van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, as aſſaulted: But the Humble ſoule, when tempted, ſayes with that worthy Convert, <hi>I am not the man that I was.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ego non ſum ego.</note> There was a time when my heart was proud, and lifted up, and then thou couldſt no ſooner knock, but I opened; no ſooner call, but I anſwered; no ſooner tempt, but I did aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: Oh! but now the Lord taught me to be humble; I can reſiſt, though I can't diſpute; I can fight, but not yeeld.</p>
            <p>Miſtriſs <hi>Catherine Bretterge</hi> (an humble precious ſoule) being once in a great Conflict with Satan, ſaid thus to him; <hi>Satan, Reaſon not with me, I am but a weake woman; if thou haſt any thing to ſay, ſay it to my Chriſt; he is my Advocate, my ſtrength, and my Redeemer, and he ſhall plead for me.</hi> An humble ſoule is good at turning Satan over to the Lord Jeſus,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:168177:33"/> and this increaſes Satans Hell. It is reported of Satan, that he ſhould ſay thus of a Learned man, <hi>Thou doeſt alwayes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome me; when I would throw thee downe, thou lifteſt up</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tu me ſemper vincis.</note> 
               <hi>thy ſelfe in aſſurance of Faith; and when I would exalt and promote thee, thou keepeſt thy ſelfe in humility; and ſo thou art too hard for me.</hi> The onely way to avoid Cannon-ſhot (as they ſay) is to fall downe flat: No ſuch way to be freed from temptations, as to keep low.</p>
            <p>And ſo I have done with the firſt Head; namely, The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives that ſhould move and provoke us, to keep humble, to be baſe, to be nothing in our owne eyes.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now come to ſome Helps, and Directions, that may be uſefull to keep us humble and low in our owne eyes: And the firſt is this,</p>

And this ſweetly and kindly melts him, and humbles him, before the Lord. Oh if ever you would have your ſoules kept low, dwell upon the free grace and love of God to you in Chriſt, Dwell upon the firſtneſſe of his love, dwell upon the freeneſſe of his love, the greatneſſe of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:168177:34"/> his love, the fullneſſe of his love, the unchangeableneſſe of his love, the everlaſtingneſſe of his love, and the activity of his love; if this doe not humble thee, there is nothing on earth will doe it. Dwell upon what God hath undertaken for you. Dwell upon the choyce and worthy gifts that he ha's beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on you: And dwell upon that glory and happineſſe that he ha's prepared for you; and then be proud if you can.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Keep faith in continuall exerciſe, upon Chriſt as</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Direction.</note> 
               <hi>crucified, and upon Chriſt as glorified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are two ſpeciall ſights of Chriſt, that tend much to humble and abaſe a ſoule.</p>
            <p>The one is, A ſight of Chriſt in his miſery, in the 12 of
<note place="margin">As one ſcale goes up, the other goes downe: So as faith goes up, the heart goes downe.</note> 
               <hi>Zech.</hi> ver. 10.</p>
            <p>And the other is, A ſight of Chriſt in his glory, <hi>Rev. 1. 7. Iſa.</hi> 6. 1, 3, 5. compared. 'Tis dangerous to be more notion, then motion; to have faith in the head, and none in the heart; to have an idle, and not an active faith. 'Tis not enough for you to have faith, but you muſt look to the acting of your faith, upon Chriſt as crucified, and upon Chriſt as glorified. Soules much in this, will be very little and low in their owne eyes. The great reaſon why the ſoule is no more humble, is; becauſe faith is no more active.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Study your owne natures more, and what ever e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill</hi>
               <note place="margin">3 Direction.</note> 
               <hi>you behold in other mens practiſes, labour to ſee the ſame in your owne nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is the ſeed of all ſins, of the vileſt and worſt of ſins, in the beſt men. When thou ſeeſt another drunk, thou mayeſt

               </note> ſee the ſeed of that ſin in thy owne nature. When thou ſeeſt another unclean, the ſeeds of uncleanneſſe thou mayeſt ſee in thy owne nature. And in that thou doeſt not act uncleanneſſe as others, it ariſes not from the goodneſſe of thy nature, but from the riches of Gods grace. Remember this, there is not a worſe nature in Hell, then that that is in thee; and it would diſcover it ſelfe accordingly, if the Lord did not reſtraine it, it would carry thee to thoſe horrid acts that are againſt the very light of nature.

            <p>There was one that was a long time tempted to three hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid ſins; to be drunk; to lye with his mother; and to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:168177:34"/> his father. Being a long time followed with theſe horrid temptations, at laſt he thought to get rid of them, by yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that he judged the leaſt, and that was to be drunk: But when he was drunk, he did both lye with his mother, and murder his father. Why, ſuch a Helliſh nature is in every ſoul that breaths; and did God leave men to act according to their natures, men would be all incarnate Devils, and this world a perfect Hell. Such is the corruption of our nature, that propound any Divine good to it, it is entertain'd as fire by water: But propound any evill, and it's like fire to ſtraw; 'tis like the fooliſh <hi>Satyr,</hi> that made haſt to kiſſe the fire; 'tis like that unctious matter, which the Naturaliſts ſay, that it ſucks and ſnatches the fire to it, with which it is conſumed. There was a holy man that rarely heard of other mens crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſins, but he uſually bedew'd the place with his tears, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that the ſeeds of thoſe very ſins was in his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. In thy nature thou haſt that that would lead thee with the Phariſees, to oppoſe Chriſt; and with <hi>Judas,</hi> to betray Chriſt; and with <hi>Pilate,</hi> to condemne Chriſt; and with the Souldiers, to crucifie Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oh what a monſter, what a Devil wouldeſt thou prove, ſhould God but leave thee to act ſutable to that finfull and wofull nature of thine?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Dwell much upon the imperfection that followes, and cleaves to thy beſt actions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh the wandrings! Oh the deadneſſe! the dullneſſe! the fruitleſneſſe of thy ſpirit in Religious duties! Man is a creature apt to hugge himſelfe in Religious ſervices, and to pride himſelfe in holy duties; and to ſtroak himſelfe after du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to warme himſelfe by the ſparkes of his owne fire (his owne performances) though he does lye downe in ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for it, <hi>Iſa. 50. ult.</hi> When ever thou comeſt off from ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſervices, ſit downe, and look over the ſpots, blots, and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes that cleave to your choyceſt ſervices.

Well, remember this, a drop of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall knowledge will more humble a man, then a ſea of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall knowledge.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, <hi>Looke up to a crucified Chriſt for ſpeciall power</hi>

               <hi>and ſtrength, againſt the pride of your hearts.</hi> 'Tis ſad in theſe knowing times to think how few there are that know the right way of bringing under the power of any ſin.

Another ſaith, ſuch a ſin followes me, and I'le hear it downe, or watch it downe, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve it downe; and ſo a crucified Chriſt is not in all their thoughts. Not but that you are to hear, pray, watch, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve againſt your ſins; but above all, you ſhould look to the acting of Faith upon a crucified Chriſt. As he ſaid of the ſword of <hi>Goliah, None like to that:</hi> So I ſay, none like to this, for the bringing under the pride of mens hearts. The weaker the Houſe of <hi>Saul</hi> grew, the ſtronger the Houſe of <hi>David</hi> grew. The weakning of your pride, will be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and ſtrengthening of your Humility; and therefore what the King of <hi>Syria</hi> ſaid unto his fifty Captaines, <hi>Fight</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:168177:37"/> 
               <hi>neither with ſmall, nor great, but with the King of Iſrael:</hi> So ſay I, if you woulk keep humble, if you would lye low, draw forth your Artillery, place your greateſt ſtrength againſt the pride of your ſoules. (The death of Pride, will be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Humility.) And that this may ſtick upon you, I ſhall lay downe ſeverall Propoſitions concerning Pride; and I am ſo much the more willing to fall upon this work, and to make it the ſubject of our diſcourſe at this time, becauſe this horrid ſin doth appeare ſo boldly, and impudently; and that not onely among prophane perſons, but Profeſſors alſo. There are ten Propoſitions that I ſhall lay downe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Pride.</p>
            <p>And the firſt is this.</p>
            <q>Of all ſinnes, Pride is moſt dangerous to the ſoules of Men.</q>
            <p>Pride is a ſin that will put the ſoule upon the worſt of ſinnes. Pride is a gilded miſery, a ſecret poyſon, a hidden plague. 'Tis the Ingeneere of deceipt, the Mother of hypocriſie, the Parent of envy, the Moth of holineſſe, the blinder of hearts, the turner of Medicines into Malladies, and
<note place="margin">A world of inſtances out of Hiſtories might be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, if it were needful, further to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence this truth.</note> Remedies into diſeaſes. 'Tis the Originall and root of moſt of thoſe notorious Vices that be to be found among the Children of men. It was pride that put <hi>Herod</hi> upon ſeeking the blood of Chriſt. 'Twas Pride that put the <hi>Phariſees</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the perſecuting of Chriſt. 'Twas Pride that made <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah</hi> deſtroy all the ſeed Royall of the houſe of <hi>Judah,</hi> that he might reigne, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. 10. 'Twas Pride that put <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab</hi> upon murdering perfidiouſly, under colour of friendſhip, <hi>Abner,</hi> 2 Sam. 3. 27. and <hi>Amaſa,</hi> 2 Sam. 10. 9, 10. <hi>Zimri</hi> out of Ambition to Reigne, murdered <hi>Elah</hi> his Lord, 1 <hi>Kings 16. 8, 9, 10. Omri</hi> out of Pride and Ambition to Reigne, roſe up againſt <hi>Zimri,</hi> and enforced him to burne himſelfe in the Kings Palace, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 16. 18. 'Tis Pride that hath uſhered in all the contentions that be in Townes, Cities, Countries, Families, and Pulpits, throughout the world. It was Pride, and Ambition to Reigne, that put <hi>Abſalom</hi> upon pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing his Fathers life, from whom he had received life.</p>
            <p>It is very remarkeable, that the Pride and Ambition of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar,</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:168177:37"/> did uſher in the deſtruction of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Monarchy. And the ambition and pride of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that did uſher in the overthrow of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy. And the ambition and pride of <hi>Allexander,</hi> was the cauſe of the annihillation of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy. And it was the pride and ambition of the <hi>Roman</hi> Commanders, was the cauſe of the utter ſubverſion of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Monarchy. There is no tongue that can expreſſe, nor heart that can conceive the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid ſins and miſeries that pride hath uſhered in among the Children of men. All ſin will downe with a proud heart, that is reſolved to riſe. Great ſins are no ſins with ſuch a ſoule; he makes nothing of thoſe very ſins that would make the very Heathen to bluſh.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Propoſition that I ſhall lay downe concerning Pride, is this;</p>
            <q>Where Pride hath poſſeſt it ſelfe throughly of the ſoule, it turnes the heart into ſteele, yea, into a rock.</q>
            <p>As you may ſee in <hi>Pharoah,</hi> pride turned his heart into
<note place="margin">Proud ſoules are of his mind that ſaid <hi>(Non per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuadebts, etiam ſi perſuaſeris)</hi> Though you do convince me, yet will I not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced.</note> ſteele, yea, into a very rock. God ſtrikes againe and againe, he ſends plague upon plague; and yet the more he is plagued, the more he is hardened. His pride turn'd his ſoule into a Rock; he is no more ſenſible of the frownes of God, the threatnings of God, the plagues, the ſtrokes of God, then a Rock: Pride had heardened his heart, he ſtirs not, he yeilds not.</p>
            <p>It was the pride of <hi>Saul</hi> that turned his heart into ſteele. <hi>I have ſinned</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>yet honour me before the people.</hi> God gave him many a blow, many a knock, and many a check, and yet after all, <hi>Honour me before the people.</hi> Oh how deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 30.</note> was his heart hardened in Pride! In <hi>Dan. 5. 10. Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzers mind</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>was hardened in pride:</hi> He ſaw the vengeance of the Almighty upon his Predeceſſors, and God took him up and laſht him till the blood came, and yet he made nothing of it, becauſe his heart was hardened in Pride. Pride ſets a man in oppoſition againſt God. Other ſins are averſions from God, but this ſin is a coming againſt God. In other ſins a man flies from God, but in this ſin a man flies upon God. <hi>James 4. 6. God reſiſteth the proud.</hi> A
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:168177:38"/> man doth not reſiſt another, till he is ſet upon; the Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler doth not reſiſt, untill ſuch time as the Thief ſets upon him. Saith the Text, <hi>God reſiſteth the proud:</hi> It intimates thus much to us, That the proud heart ſets upon God himſelfe, and therefore God reſiſts him. The Greek word is, <hi>Antitaſetai,</hi> he places himſelfe in Battell array againſt the proud: God brings forth his <hi>Battalia</hi> againſt the proud, and they bring forth their <hi>Battalia</hi> againſt God. A proud heart reſiſts, and is reſiſted, this is <hi>(duro durum)</hi> flint to flint, fire to fire, yet in the day of Gods wrath, the proud ſhall be burnt up as ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, both branch and root, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4. 1.</p>
            <p>The third Propoſition concerning Pride, is this,</p>
            <q>Pride is a ſin that ſhales forth, and ſhewes it ſelfe, not one way, but many wayes.</q>
            <q>For inſtance:</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Sometimes it ſhewes it ſelfe <hi>in the lookes. Prov.</hi> 6. 17. he tells you of ſeven things that the Lord hates, and one
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Profuto oculis animus inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat.</hi> Plin.</note> is, <hi>A proud look.</hi> The Hebrew word there, is, <hi>The haughty eye.</hi> The haughty eye God hates. Mens hearts uſually ſhew themſelves in their eyes. <hi>Pſal. 131. 1. Mine heart is not haughty, nor mine eye lofty.</hi> There be ſuch who ſhew pride in their very looks, but the Lord looks aloof at them, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 138. 6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Sometimes Pride ſhewes it ſelfe <hi>in words. Dan. 4. 30. Is not this great Babylon that I have built, for the houſe of the Kingdome, by the might of my power, and for the honour of my Majeſty?</hi> And in <hi>Chap. 3. 15. Who is that God that ſhall deliver you out of my hands?</hi> It was a very proud ſaying of one <hi>(Coelum gratis non accipiam) I will not have Heaven, but at a rate.</hi> And of another, <hi>Wee have not ſo liv'd, and deſerved of God, that the Enemy ſhould vanquiſh us.</hi> Theſe were the proud ones, that ſpake loftily, and that <hi>ſet their mouths againſt the Heavens,</hi> as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 6, 8, 9. comp. And ſuch a one was <hi>Henry the Second,</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his City <hi>Mentz</hi> was taken, he uſed this proud blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous ſpeech, <hi>I ſhall never love God any more, that ſuffered a City ſo deare to me, to be taken away from me.</hi> Such a proud wretch, both in words and actions, was <hi>Senacherib,</hi> as you
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:168177:38"/> may ſee in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. from the 8 verſe, to the 18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Sometimes Pride ſhewes it ſelfe <hi>in the habit of the body.</hi> So <hi>Herod's</hi> pride appeared, <hi>Acts 12. 21. Herod was arrayed in Royall Apparrell; In cloath of ſilver</hi> (ſaith <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus)</hi> which being beaten upon by the Sun-beams, dazzled the peoples eyes, and drew from them that blaſphemous Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, <hi>It is the voyce of God, and not of man.</hi> (The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being moſt commonly like the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Curres, that uſed to fawne upon a good Sute.) So the Rich man, <hi>Luke 16. 19. was cloathed in Purple (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) and in Silke.</hi> He was commonly ſo cloathed, it was his every-dayes weare, as the
<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> Greek word implyeth.</p>
            <p>But here a Queſtion may be askt, <hi>May not perſons habite</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Queſt."/> 
               <hi>themſelves according to their dignities, ranks, and places, that God hath put them in, in the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, They may and ought ſo to doe, if God hath lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Anſw."/> them up in the world above others, they may wear better Apparrell then others. <hi>Gen. 41. 42. Eſth. 6. 8. Pſal. 45. 13, 14. 2 Sam. 13. 18. Lam. 4. 5. Mat. 11. 8. Gen. 27. 15. Iſa. 52. 1. Hoſ. 2. 13. Exod.</hi> 28. 40. I cite theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſo much the rather, becauſe ſome through weakneſſe and peeviſhneſſe ſtumble, and are not ſatisfied herein. There is nothing in the Law of God or nature againſt it.</p>
            <p>But you may ſay, <hi>May not perſous ſin in their Appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell?</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Queſt."/>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, Yes, and that in foure Caſes.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Anſw."/>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 When 'tis not Modeſt, but carries with it provocation to luſt and wantonneſſe. <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 10. There met the young man <hi>A woman in the Attire of an Harlot.</hi> The Hebrew word ſignifies a Habit or Ornament finely ſet and fitted to the body. And ſaith the Text, <hi>She was ſuttle of heart,</hi> or truſt up about the Breaſts, with her upper parts naked, ſo <hi>Levi-Ben-Gerſom</hi> reads the words, <hi>She met him with her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Breaſts:</hi> At this day too commonly uſed, by ſuch as would not be held Harlots. Oh what a horrid ſhame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach is it to Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>igion, the wayes of God, and the people of God, that Profeſſors ſhould goe ſo. One ſaith, <hi>That ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous Apparrell is worſe then whoredoome, becauſe whoredome</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:168177:39"/> 
               <hi>onely corrupts chaſtity, but this corrupts Nature.</hi> Another ſaith, <hi>If women adorne themſelves ſo as to provoke men to luſt after them, though no ill follow upon it, yet thoſe women ſhall ſuffer eternall damnation, becauſe they offered poyſon to others, though none would drinke of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 Perſons ſin in their Apparell, when as they exceed their degree and rank, in coſtly Apparrell, which is that which is condemned by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim. 2. 9. 1 Pet.</hi> 3. 3. The Apoſtle doth not ſimply condemne the wearing of gold, but he condemnes it in thoſe that goe above their degree, and rank. The words are rather an Admonition, then a Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="3">3 It's ſinfull, when 'tis ſo expenſive as that it hinders works of Mercy and Charity. Oh how many Proud ſoules be there in theſe dayes that lay ſo much upon their backs, that they can ſpare nothing to fill the Poores bellies. <hi>Silke doth quench the fire of the Kitchin,</hi> ſaith the <hi>French</hi> Proverb: The meaning is, that it doth hinder works of Charity and Mercy. Surely thoſe that put on ſuch coſtly Ornaments upon their backs, as cloſe up the hand of Charity, will at laſt ſhare with <hi>Dives</hi> in his miſery.</p>
            <p n="4">4 When perſons habite themſelves in ſtrange and forraine faſhions, which is the ſin, ſhame, and reproach of many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us in theſe dayes. Now that is ſtrange Apparrell which is not peculiar to the Nations where men live. The Lord threatens to puniſh ſuch, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1. 8. that <hi>are cloathed with ſtrange Apparrell.</hi> There are too many women and men in our dayes, that are like the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Temples, very Gypſies, painted without, and ſpotted within; Varniſh without, and Vermin within.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mercury</hi> being to make a Garment for the Moon (as one ſaith) could never fit her, but either the Garment would be too bigge, or too little, by reaſon ſhe was alwayes increaſing or decreaſing. May not this be applied: to the vaine curioſity of too too many Profeſſors in theſe dayes, whoſe cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity about their cloaths can never be ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude this Head with this Councel, <hi>Cloath your ſelves with the Silke of Piety, with the Sattin of Sanctity;</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:168177:39"/> 
               <hi>and with the Purple of Modeſty, and God himſelfe will be a Suiter to you.</hi> Let not the Ornaments upon your backs, ſpeak out the vanity of your hearts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Sometimes Pride ſhewes it ſelfe <hi>by the geſture and carriage of the body.</hi> In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3. 16. the Daughters of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were haughty, and walked with ſtretched out necks, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton eyes, walking and mincing as they goe, making a tinkling with their feet.</hi> Oh Earth! Earth! doeſt thou not groan to bear ſuch Monſters as theſe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> And ſometimes Pride ſhewes it ſelfe <hi>in contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous challenges of God;</hi> as <hi>Pharoah, Who is the God of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes, that I ſhould obey him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Sometimes Pride ſhewes it ſelfe <hi>by bragging pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. I will ariſe, I will purſue, I will overtake, I will divide</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 14.</note> 
               <hi>the ſpoyle, and my luſts ſhall be ſatisfied.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth Propoſition that I ſhall lay downe, is this.</p>
            <q>Pride is a ſin that of all ſins makes a man or woman, moſt like to Satan.</q>
            <p>Pride is <hi>(Morbus Satanicus) Satans Diſeaſe:</hi> Pride is ſo baſe a diſeaſe, that God had rather ſee his deareſt Children to be buffeted by Satan, then that in Pride they ſhould be like to Satan. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. When <hi>Paul</hi> under the abundance of Revelations, was in danger of being pufft up, the Lord rather then he would have him proud, like to Satan, ſuffers him to be buffeted by Satan. Humility makes a Man like to Angels, and Pride makes an Angel a Devil. Pride is worſe then the Devil, for the Devil cannot hurt thee, till Pride hath poſſeſt thee. If you would ſee the Devil Limned to the life, look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a proud ſoule; for as face anſwers to face, ſo doth a proud ſoule anſwer to Satan. Proud ſoules are Satans Apes, and none imitate him to the life like theſe: And oh that they were ſenſible of it, before it be too late, before the doore of darkneſſe be ſhut upon them.</p>
            <p>A fifth Propoſition is this,</p>
            <q>Pride cannot climb ſo high, but Juſtice will ſit above her.</q>
            <p>One askt a Philoſopher, <hi>what God was a doing?</hi> he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>That his whole worke was to exalt the humble, and pull downe the proud.</hi> It was Pride that turned Angels into De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:168177:40"/> they would be above others in Heaven, and therefore God caſt them downe to Hell. <hi>Pride</hi> (ſaith <hi>Hugo) was borne in Heaven, but forgetting by what way ſhe fell from thence, ſhe could never find the way thither againe.</hi> The firſt man would know as God, and the <hi>Babel</hi> builders would dwell as God, but Juſtice ſet above them all. This truth you ſee verified in the Juſtice of God upon <hi>Pharoah, Haman, Herod, Beltſhazzar,</hi> and <hi>Nebuchadnezzer;</hi> all theſe would be very high, but Juſtice takes the right hand of them all, and brings them downe to the duſt. Yea Pride cannot climb ſo high in the hearts of the Saints, but Divine Juſtice will be above it. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> his heart was lifted up, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. 27. but Juſtice ſmites him with a <hi>Leproſie,</hi> and ſo he died, out of griefe and ſorrow, ſaith <hi>Joſephus. David</hi> glories in his owne greatneſſe, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 32. and for this ſeventy-thouſand fall by the hand of Juſtice. <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> heart was lifted up, but wrath was upon him, and upon all <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for it, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 32, 33. Pride ſets it ſelfe againſt the Honour, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Soveraignty of God, therefore Juſtice will in ſpight of all, ſit above her. Other ſins ſtrike at the word of God, the people of God, and the Creatures of God, but Pride ſtrikes directly at the very Being of God, and therefore Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice will be above her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nebuchadnezzer</hi> was Proud, and God ſmites his reaſon, and turnes him into a Beaſt. Oh how many young Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Staupecius</hi> was proud of his memory, and Juſtice ſmote it.</note> are there in our dayes, who have been proud of their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and proud of their parts and gifts, and Juſtice hath ſo ſmitten them, that they have loſt that life, that ſweetneſſe, that ſpiritualneſſe, that quickneſſe, that once they had; and are dryed and ſhrivel'd up by a hand of Juſtice. They are like the Apples of <hi>Sodom,</hi> glorious without, but rotten and worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe within. Some there are that have been very ſhining, yet by reaſon of Pride have fallen from a ſeeming excellency, to be naught, and from naught, to be very naught, and from ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry naught, to be ſtark naught. <hi>Iſa. 23. 9. The Lord of Hoſts hath purpoſed it, to ſtaine the pride of all glory, and to bring into contempt</hi> (or to make light) <hi>all the honourable of the earth.</hi> The Hebrew word that is here rendred <hi>Purpoſed,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:168177:40"/> to <hi>conſult,</hi> or <hi>take councel:</hi> It is conſulted, and agreed
<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Deliberately to conſult &amp; agree upon a thing.</note> upon in Councel, that he will ſtaine the pride of all glory, and bring into contempt the Honourable of the Earth: And <hi>the councell of the Lord ſhall ſtand,</hi> Pſal. 33. 11. In <hi>Iſa. 2. 11, 12. The lofty looks of man ſhall be humbled, and the haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of men ſhall be bowed downe, and the Lord alone ſhall be exalted in that day. For the day of the Lord of Hoſts ſhall be upon every one that is proud, and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up, and he ſhall be brought low.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Divine Juſtice will take the right hand of all proud ones on the Earth. God bears (as I may ſay) a ſpeciall ſpleen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Pride. His heart hates it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 16, 17. His mouth curſes it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 21. And his hand plagueth it, as you have ſeen in the former inſtances, and as you may ſee further in theſe following Inſtances.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that <hi>Jeremiah</hi> Propheſied againſt, in his 44<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter, was ſo pufft up with Pride, that he boaſted his Kingdome was ſo ſurely ſettled, that it could not be taken from him either by God, or man; not long after he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in Battel by <hi>Amaſis,</hi> one of his owne Subjects, and hanged up.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dyoniſius</hi> the Tyrant, ſaid in the Pride of his heart, <hi>That his Kingdome was bound to him with Chaines of Adamant;</hi> but time ſoon confuted him, for he was driven out, and forced to teach a School at <hi>Corinth,</hi> for a poor living.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cares,</hi> a Souldier, being proud of his valour, becauſe he had given <hi>Cyrus</hi> a great wound, ſhortly after he ran mad. In all Ages there are notable inſtances to prove that pride ha's not got ſo high, but Juſtice ha's ſet above her.</p>
            <p>The ſixth Propoſition, is this.</p>
            <q>Of all ſins ſpirituall Pride is moſt dangerous, and muſt be moſt reſiſted.</q>
            <p>Spirituall Pride is the lifting up of the mind againſt God, it is a tumor and ſwelling in the mind, and lyes in contemning and ſlighting of God, his Word, Promiſes, and Ordinances, and in the lifting up of a mans ſelfe, by reaſon of birth, breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wealth, honour, place, relation, gifts, or graces, and in deſpiſing of others. Of this ſpirituall Pride <hi>Habakkuk</hi> ſpeaks,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:168177:41"/> 
               <hi>Chap. 2. 4. His heart that is lifted up in him, is not upright. Prov. 16. 5. Every one that is proud in heart, is an Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the Lord,</hi> or that lifts up his heart againſt God or his Decrees: as <hi>Lewis the Eleventh</hi> did, in that proud ſpeech of his, <hi>If I ſhall be ſaved, I ſhall be ſaved; and if I</hi>
               <note place="margin">Si ſalvab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r. Si vero damnabor, damnabor.</note> 
               <hi>ſhall be damned, I ſhall be damned; and there's all the care that I ſhall take.</hi> Like to this, was that proud and wretched ſpeech of one <hi>Ruffus,</hi> who painted God on the one ſide of his Shield, and the Devil on the other, with this mad Motto, <hi>If thou wilt not have me, here's one will.</hi> Spirituall Pride is a white Devil, as one calls it, a gilded Poyſon, by which God is robbed of his honour, a mans owne ſoule of his comfort and peace, and others of that benefit and fruit which otherwiſe they might receive from us. Satan is ſuttle, he will make a man proud of his very graces: He will make him Proud, that he is not Proud. Pride growes with the decreaſe of other ſins, aed thrives by their decay: Other ſins are nouriſhed by poyſonous roots, as Adultery is nouriſhed by Idleneſſe; and Gluttony and Murder, by malice and envy: But this white Devil, Spirituall Pride, ſprings from good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and good actions, towards God and man. Spirituall Pride is a very great Enemy to the good, and ſalvation of men. Pride is like a very great ſwelling, which unfits men for any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <p>Againe, Spirituall Pride is a very great Enemy to the good and ſalvation of men. The Greek word ſignifies <hi>Swelleth,</hi> for Pride is like a great ſwelling in the body, which unfits it for any good ſervice. <hi>John 5. 40. You will not come to me, that you may have life.</hi> And, <hi>verſ. 44. How can ye beleeve in me, which ſeeke honour one of another?</hi> Chriſt bleſſes his father, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. that he had <hi>hid thoſe things from the wiſe and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and had revealed them unto Babes and Sucklings.</hi> 'Tis the Pride of mens hearts, that makes them throw off Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, as poor and low things; when alas in their practices they live below the power, beauty, glory, and holineſſe, of the leaſt and loweſt Ordinance. There's more holineſſe, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and glory, manifeſted in the loweſt Adminiſtrations of Chriſt, then is held forth by them; in their higheſt practiſes.</p>
            <pb n="57" facs="tcp:168177:41"/>
            <p>The ſeventh Propoſition is this,</p>
            <q>Pride un-mans a man, it makes him doe acts that are below a man.</q>
            <p>As you may ſee in <hi>Pharoah, Haman, Herod, Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi> &amp;c. It makes men Bedlams, to ſay they know not what, and to doe they care not what. It was Pride that made <hi>Hildebrand</hi> to cauſe <hi>Henry the Fourth</hi> to ſtand 3 dayes at his Gate, with his Wife, &amp; his Child, barefooted. It was Pride that made <hi>Adoni-bezek</hi> cauſe three-ſcore and ten Kings (with
<note place="margin">Judges 1. 5. 6, 7.</note> their Thumbs and great Toes cut off) to gather their meat under his Table. Oh what wretched un-manly acts, hath the Pride of many perſons put them upon!</p>
            <p>The eighth Propoſition is this,</p>
            <q>The Pooreſt are often-times the Proudeſt.</q>
            <p>Pretty is the Parable of <hi>Jotham, The beſt Trees refuſed to be King, but the Bramble affected it;</hi> and did <hi>(ſperare &amp; aſpirare)</hi> hope and aſpire it, <hi>Judges</hi> 9. 15. So in 2 <hi>Kings 14. 9. The Thiſtle that was in Lebanon, ſent to the Cedar that was in Lebanon, ſaying, Give thy Daughter to my Son to Wife. Hagar</hi> the Kitchin-maid will be proud, and inſult
<note place="margin">Gen. 21. Mat. 20. 20, 21. Job 30. 1.</note> over her Miſtreſs <hi>Sarah.</hi> The poor Sons of <hi>Zebedee</hi> would ſit at Chriſts right hand, and left. And thoſe that <hi>Job</hi> diſdaines <hi>to ſit with the Doggs of his flocke,</hi> yet contemne him in the day of his ſorrow. The foot ſtrives to be equall with the head, the Servant, as the Maſter; the Cobler, as the Councellor; and the Peaſant, as the Prince, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ninth Propoſition is this,</p>
            <q>Pride is a ſure fore-runner of a fall.</q>
            <p>Pride goes before deſtruction, and a haughty mind, before a fall. <hi>Herod</hi> fell from a Throne of Gold, to a Bed of duſt.
<note place="margin">Prov. 16. 18. Chap. 18. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> fell from the ſtate of a mighty King, to be a Beaſt. <hi>Adam</hi> fell from Innocency, to Mortality. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels fell from Heaven, to Hell; from felicity, to miſery.</p>
            <p>The tenth and laſt Propoſition, is this,</p>
            <q>God will by an inviſible power, carry the day againſt proud ſoules.</q>
            <p>You that it eſcape, and ruffle it out, and carry it with a high hand, remember this, God will by an inviſible power,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:168177:42"/> carry the day againſt you, when you think not of it, he will
<note place="margin">Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the fourth, as he was walk<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing ſecurely in his Pallace heard that ſorrowfull and dreadfull Summons <hi>(Veni miſer in judicium) come thou wretch; receive thy judgement,</hi> and ſoon after he was found dead. Eccl. 8. 11.</note> eat you out like a Moth. <hi>Iſa. 47. 10, 11. For thou haſt truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thy wickedneſſe, thou haſt ſaid, None ſeeth me. Thy wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and thy knowledge it hath perverted thee: And thou haſt ſaid in thine heart, I am, and none elſe beſides me. Therefore ſhall evill come upon thee, thou ſhalt not know from whence it riſeth, and miſchiefe ſhall fall upon thee, thou ſhalt not be able to put it off. And deſolation ſhall come upon thee ſuddainly, which thou ſhalt not know.</hi> Impunity oftentimes cauſeth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudency, but <hi>(Quod defertyr non aufertur)</hi> Forbearance is no Acquittance: The longer the hand is lifted up, the heas vier will be the blow at laſt. Of all Mettals, <hi>Lead</hi> is the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, but being melted, it becomes the hotteſt. Humble ſoule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know how to apply this, and Proud ſoules ſhall ſooner or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter experience this.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed to a ſecond Obſervation; namely,</p>
            <q>That all Saints are not of an equall cize and growth
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2 Obſerv:"/> in Grace and Holineſſe.</q>
            <p>Some are higher, and ſome are lower; ſome are ſtronger, and ſome are weaker, in ſpirituall Graces, and Heavenly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto me who am leſſe then the leaſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Among true Believers, ſome may be found to be but weak Believers. This Point flowes as naturall from the words, as the ſtream do's from the fountaine; and no Point more clear in all the Scripture, then this.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1. you read of ſome that are weake in the faith, <hi>Them that are weake in the faith receive,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. None are to be rejected in whom <hi>(Aliquid Chriſti)</hi> any thing of Chriſt is to be found. And ſo, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14. 31. there is mention made of <hi>little faith. 1 Cor. 9. 22. To the weak became I as weake, that I might gaine the weake.</hi> You read of <hi>Babes in Grace,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 2, 3. <hi>As new borne babes, deſire the ſincere milke of the word, that you may grow thereby, if ſo be that yee have taſted that the Lord is gratious. 1 John</hi> 2. 12, 13, 14. there is mention made of <hi>little children,</hi> of <hi>young men;</hi> and of <hi>Fathers.</hi> All are not Fathers in grace, nor all are not young men in grace; there are ſome Children in grace.
<note place="margin">It is with Chriſtians as tis with Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets. The Moon goes her courſe in a month; the Sun in a year, the reſt not in many years yet at length they finiſh.</note> A Chriſtian in this life hath his degrees of growth; he is
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:168177:42"/> firſt a Child in Grace, and then a young Man in Grace, and then a Father in Grace.</p>
            <p>For the further opening of this Point, I ſhall endeavour theſe foure things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 I ſhall endeavour to decipher to you, ſoules weak in Grace.</item>
               <item>2 I ſhall endeavour to lay downe thoſe things that may Incourage, Support, and Comfort ſoules that are weak in Grace.</item>
               <item>3 I ſhall ſpeake to the Duties that lye upon thoſe that are weak in Grace.</item>
               <item>4 The Duties that lye upon thoſe that are ſtrong in grace, towards thoſe that are weak in grace.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Of theſe foure we ſhall ſpeak, as the Lord ſhall aſſiſt.</p>
            <p>I ſhall begin with the firſt, To decipher ſoules weak in Grace.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing by which I ſhall decipher ſoules weak in Grace, is this.</p>
            <q>Weak Chriſtians are uſually carried much out after the poore low things of this world.</q>
            <p>They are much in carking and caring for them, and in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing and hunting greedily after them. That's a clear Text for this, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 24. to the end. Chriſt labours by ſeverall weighty Arguments to fence and fortifie his Diſciples againſt thoſe diſſident, doubtfull, carking cares, that divide, diſtract, diſtemper, torture, and teare the heart in a thouſand pieces. And yet neither theſe Arguments, nor yet the preſence of him who was the great Land-lord of Heaven and Earth (and whoſe love and bowels were ſtill yearning towards them, and whoſe ſpeciall eye of providence was ſtill over them) could rid their heads and hearts of theſe worldly cares (that doe but vex and perplex the ſoules of men.) And 'tis very obſervable, that after this ſmart Lecture that Chriſt had read them, they did ſtrive three ſeverall times, who ſhould be greateſt and higheſt in worldly Enjoyments. Their hearts ſhould have been onely in Heaven, and yet they ſtrive for Earth, as if there were no Heaven, or as if Earth were better then Heaven. All which do's cleerly evidence, that their Graces were very
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:168177:43"/> weak, and their corruptions very ſtrong. Men that have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the upper ſprings within, are carried out much after the ſprings below. <hi>Baruch</hi> was good, but weak in Grace, he had but ſome ſips and taſts of the glory of that other world, and
<note place="margin">Jerem. 45. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> that made him (when God was a pulling downe all worldly glory) to ſeek for Earth, as if there were no Heaven. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there is but little of Chriſt and Grace within, where the heart is ſo ſtrongly carried ont after theſe things without. Where there is ſuch ſtrong love, and workings of heart after theſe poor things, it ſpeaks out ſoules enjoyment of God, to be but poor and low.</p>
            <p>In the Old Teſtament, the <hi>Jewes</hi> being Babes and Infants in grace and holineſſe, had a world of Temporall Promiſes, and very few Spirituall Promiſes: But now in the dayes of the Goſpel, the Lord is pleaſed to double and trebble his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit upon his people, and now you meet with very few tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Promiſes in the Goſpel, but the Goſpel is fill'd with ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Promiſes; the Goſpel drops nothing but marrow and fatneſſe, love and ſweetneſſe; and therefore God looks in theſe dayes that men ſhould grow up to a greater height of holineſſe, heavenlineſſe, and ſpiritualneſſe, then what they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to in thoſe dark dayes, wherein the Sun ſhin'd but dimly. Men rich and ſtrong in Grace, look upon the world with a holy ſcorne, and diſdaine, as <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> when he ſaw in the dark a thing like a Pearle, he ſcorn'd to ſtoop for it himſelfe, ſaying to another, <hi>Stoop thee, for thou art not Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocles. Abraham,</hi> a man ſtrong in Grace, look't with a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcorne, and with an eye of diſdaine upon theſe poor things. When <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> from God had made him Heire of all things, he refuſed the Riches that the King of <hi>Sodome</hi> offered
<note place="margin">Gen. 14. 21. Chap. 15. 1.</note> him, becauſe God was his Shield, and his exceeding great Reward. The greateſt bargaine that a ſoule rich in Grace will make with God for himſelfe, is this, Give me but bread to eat, and cloaths to wear, and thou ſhalt be my God; ſo it was with that brave ſoul, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 21. he deſires but Food and Rayment. Marke, he asks <hi>food,</hi> not <hi>junkets; Rayment,</hi> not <hi>Ornaments.</hi> A <hi>little</hi> will ſerve a man that is <hi>ſtrong</hi> in grace; <hi>much</hi> will not ſerve a man that is <hi>weak</hi> in grace; <hi>nothing</hi> will
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:168177:43"/> ſerve a man that is <hi>voyd</hi> of grace. Soules weak in grace, have their hearts much working after theſe poore low things, as you may ſee, <hi>Mat. 18. 1. Who ſhall be greateſt in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven?</hi> The Queſtion is ſtated by the Diſciples, that one would have thought ſhould have had their hearts and thoughts in Heaven; but they dream'd of an earthly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, where honours and Offices ſhould be diſtributed, as in the dayes of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon.</hi> And 'tis obſerveable in <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 33, 34. they are at it againe, <hi>And he came to Capernaum, and being in the houſe, he asked them, What was it that ye diſputed among your ſelves by the way? But they</hi>
               <note place="margin">So in <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 46.</note> 
               <hi>held their peace,</hi> (they were aſham'd to tell him) <hi>for by the way they had diſputed among themſelves, who ſhould be greateſt.</hi> Saith one, I'le have this, &amp; ſaith another, I'le have that, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or as 'tis in the Greek, <hi>they diſputed who was greateſt;</hi> ſayes one, I am greater then thou; no, ſays another, I am greateſt.

So <hi>Luther</hi> (a man ſtrong in grace) when he had a Gowne, and Money given him, by the Elector, he turned himſelfe about, and ſaid, <hi>I proteſt God ſhall not put me off with theſe poore low things.</hi> Soules that know (by experience) what the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of Chriſt is, what ſpirituall Communion is, what the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Heaven is, will not be put off, by God nor man, with
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:168177:44"/> things that are mixt, mutable, and momentary. And to ſhame many profeſſors in theſe dayes, I might bring in a Cloud of Witneſſes, even from among the very Heathen, who never heard of a Crucified Chriſt, and yet were more Crucified to things below Chriſt, then many of them that pretend much to Chriſt: But I ſhall forbear, onely deſiring, that thoſe that think and ſpeak ſo ſcornfully and contemptuouſly of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, may not at laſt be found worſe then Heathens; yea, be judged and condemned by Heathens, in the great and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible day of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In order to a further deciphering of weak Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, I ſhall lay downe this.</p>
            <q>That weak Saints doe uſually over-feare troubles before they come: Yea, thoſe future evills, that forty to one may never fall out.</q>
            <p>The very empty thoughts, and conceit of trouble, is very terrible and perplexing to a weak Saint. When it was told

            <p>Thirdly,</p>
            <q>Fainting in the day of Adverſity, ſpeaks out the ſoule to be but weak in Grace.</q>
            <p>Weak Chriſtians are overcome with little croſſes; the leaſt croſſe doth not onely ſtartle them, but it ſinks them, and makes them ready to ſit downe, and to cry out with the Church, <hi>Behold you that paſſe by, ſee whether there be any ſorrow like my ſorrow.</hi> Before trouble comes, weak Chriſtians
<note place="margin">Lam. 1. 12.</note> are apt to think that they can bear much, and indure much; but alaſſe when the day of Tryall comes upon them, when they are put to it, they prove but men of poor and impotent ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; and then they roare, and complaine, and lye downe in the duſt, ſuffering croſſes and loſſes to bind them hand and foot, and to ſpoyle them of all their Comforts: And now though they have many comforts for one croſſe; yet one croſſe doth ſo damp and daunt their hearts, that joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort flyes away from them, and they ſit down overwhelmed. Certainly this ſpeaks out little of Chriſt within. All <hi>Rachels</hi> comforts, were no comforts, <hi>becauſe her Children were not.</hi> This ſpeaks out much weakneſſe within.</p>

Man hath no triall of his ſtrength, till he be in trouble; faintneſſe then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers weakneſſe. Afflictions try what ſapp we have, as hard weather tryes what health we have. A weak Chriſtian ſinks under a little burden; every frowne, every ſowre word, every
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:168177:45"/> puffe of wind blowes him downe, and makes him ſinke under his burden: But now a ſoule ſtrong in grace, bears up bravely againſt all winds and weather. That's a brave Text (and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be written in letters of gold) that you have in <hi>Gen. 49. 23, 24.

Thoſe that are ſtrong in grace, ſeldome want courage or counſell, when they are at the worſt: They alwayes find their hope to be an Anchor at Sea, and their faith a Shield upon Land: and therefore they triumph in all ſtormes and dangers: They ſtand firme when they are under the greateſt preſſures, 2 <hi>Cor. 11. 23.</hi> I, labours more abundant, <hi>In ſtripes above meaſure,</hi>

Whereas ſoules ſtrong in grace, ſuffer much, and yet count that much, but little.

            <p>Fifthly,</p>
            <q>Thoſe that are weak in Grace dwell more upon what may diſcourage them, in the wayes of Grace and Holineſſe, then they doe upon what may incourage them.</q>
            <p>They dwell more upon their ſins, then upon a Saviour; more upon their miſery, then upon free grace and mercy; more upon that which may feed their feares, then upon that that may ſtrengthen their faith; more upon the Croſſe, then upon the Crowne; more upon thoſe that are againſt them, then thoſe that are for them. <hi>Iſa. 51. 12, 13.

So in 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 16, 17, 18. Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for us a far more exceeding, and eternall weight of glory; while we look not</hi> (mark, they are not doting upon their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements) <hi>upon things that are ſeen, but upon things that are not ſeene. The things which are ſeen, are tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, but the things which are not ſeen, are eternall.</hi> An eye fixt upon incouragements, makes heavy afflictions light; long afflictions ſhort; and bitter afflictions ſweet. Thoſe bleſſed Martyrs found it ſo, that <hi>were caſt out all night, in a cold froſty night, and were to be burnt the next day;</hi> who thus comforted themſelves, <hi>The winter is ſharpe, but Paradiſe is ſweet; here we ſhiver for cold, but the boſome of Abraham will make amends for all.</hi> Weak Chriſtians have eyes to behold their diſcouragements, but none to ſee their incouragements; they look more upon their corruption, then upon their ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: Upon their diſobedience, then their obedience; upon their diſtruſt, then upon their faith; upon the old man, then upon the new; and this keeps them low and weak in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituals, it cauſes a leanneſſe in their ſoules.</p>

            <p>Weak Chriſtians are uſually moſt zealous about Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and things that have leaſt of God and Chriſt, and the power of holineſſe in them; and moſt cold about ſubſtances, as wofull experience doth evidence in theſe dayes.

I have fed you with milke, and not with meat, for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able; for are ye not yet carnall? for whereas there is among you envying, and ſtrife, and diviſions, are ye not carnall, and walke as men? for while one ſaith, I am of Paul, and another, I am of Apollo, are ye not carnall?</hi> They were advanced but very little above the imperfections, and paſſions, and ſins of meer men, of ſuch which had nothing of the Spirit in them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Doe wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men quarrell with their Teachers, as ſhallow triviall Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, when themſelves are in fault, as being not capable of more Myſterious matter?

Or as ſhe that being ſtruck with a ſuddaine blindneſſe, bid open the window, when as it was not the want of light, but want of ſight, that troubled her. So did theſe Babes in the Text, lay the fault of their non-proficiency, upon their Teachers, when the fault was wholly in themſelves.</p>
            <p>Now he calls them <hi>Carnall,</hi> partly becauſe the fleſh was ſtrong in them; and partly, becauſe they followed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed the things of the fleſh; and partly, becauſe they did in their actions reſemble carnall men.

Ah Chriſtians! if you don't mind your wages more then your work, <hi>what means the bleating of the ſheep, and the lowing of the Oxen?</hi> What means thoſe earneſt and vehement cryings out, and wreſtings for joy, peace, comfort, and aſſurance? when the great work of believing, of waiting, and of walking with God, is ſo much neglected, and diſ-regarded. But now ſtrong Saints are more mindfull of their work, then they are of their wages. Lord, ſaith a ſtrong Saint, doe but uphold me in a way of believing, in a way of working, in a way of holy walking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and it ſhall be enough, though I ſhould never have Aſſurance, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, peace, or joy, till my dying day.

I know, ſayes ſuch a ſoule, though a life of comfort be moſt pleaſing to me, yet a life of believing (ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted from comfort) is moſt honourable to thee, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will be ſilent before thee. Lord doe but help me in my work, and take thine owne time to give me my wages; to give me comfort, joy, peace, aſſurance. They are none of the beſt Servants, that mind their wages more then their work: Nor they are none of the beſt Chriſtians, that mind their comforts, and their incomes, more then that homage and duty that they owe to God.</p>
            <p>Before I come to the ſecond thing premiſed, give me leave to give you this hint, <hi>viz. That there is no ſuch way to joy, peace, and Aſſurance, as this, to mind your worke more then your wages.</hi> Ah! had many mourning, complaing Chriſtians done thus, their mourning before this, had been turn'd into rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and their complainings into ſingings. Chriſtians, the high way to comfort, is to mind comfort leſſe, and duty more; 'tis to mind more what thou ſhouldeſt doe, then what thou wouldeſt have, as you may ſee in <hi>Epheſ. 1. 13.

            <p>Thus by Divine aſſiſtance I have diſpatched the firſt thing, <hi>viz. The deciphering of weake Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond thing that I propounded for the further open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and clearing of this Point, was, <hi>To hold forth to you thoſe things that tend to ſupport, comfort, and uphold weak Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> And truly I muſt needs ſay, that if ever there were a time wherein weak Chriſtians had need of ſupport, I verily believe this is the time wherein we live; for by the horrid prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of men on the one hand; and the abominable, looſe, and rotten Principles of others on the other hand, the hearts of many, weak Chriſtans eſpecially, are ſadded, that God would not have ſadded, and their ſpirits wounded and grieved, that God would have comforted, and healed; and therefore I ſhall dwell the longer upon this ſecond thing.</p>
            <p>And the firſt thing that I ſhall lay downe by way of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, is this.

                  </gap>haſer of Chriſt.</note>
            </p>
            <q>That the weakeſt Chriſtians have as much intereſt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in Chriſt, and all the fundamentall good that comes by Chriſt, as the ſtrongeſt Saints in the world have.</q>
            <p>Weak Saints are as much united to Chriſt, as much juſtified by Chriſt, as much reconciled by Chriſt, and as much pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Chriſt, as the ſtrongeſt Saints. 'Tis true, weak Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians cannot make ſo much improvement and advantage of their intereſt in Chriſt, as ſtrong Saints can; they have not that power, that wiſedome, that ſpirituall skill to make that advantage of their intereſt and propriety in Chriſt, as ſtrong Saints have: Yet have they as much intereſt and propriety in the Lord Jeſus, and all the fundamentall good that comes by him, as the ſtrongeſt Saint that breaths. The ſucking Child hath as much intereſt and propriety in the father, and in what
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:168177:51"/> is the fathers, as the Child that's growne up to age: Though the young Child ha's not that skill, nor that power, nor wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to improve that intereſt to his advantage, as he that's growne up in years hath. It's juſt ſo here, A ſoule weak in grace, hath as much intereſt in the Lord, as the ſtrongeſt Saint hath; though he hath not that skill to improve that intereſt. And is not this a ſingular comfort and ſupport? Verily were there no more to bear up a poor weak Saint from fainting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all his ſins, and ſorrowes, and ſufferings, yet this alone might doe it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Second Support and Comfort to weake Saints, is this.</p>
            <q>That God doth with an eye of love reflect upon the leaſt good
<note place="margin">2 Support.</note> that is in them, or done by them.</q>
            <p>And is not this a glorious Comfort and Support, that the Lord looks with an eye of love upon the leaſt good that's in you, or done by you? You cannot have a good thought, but
<note place="margin">The leaſt Star gives light; the leaſt drop moyſtens.</note> God looks upon that thought with an eye of love. <hi>Pſal. 32. 5. I ſaid I would confeſſe my ſin, and thou forgaveſt mine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. I ſaid</hi> it in my thoughts, that <hi>I would confeſſe my ſin, and</hi> thou preſently meeting me with pardoning mercy, <hi>forga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt mine iniquity.</hi> So in <hi>Mal. 3. 16. And there was a Book of Remembrance written, for them that feare the Lord, and that thought upon his name.</hi> They had but ſome thoughts of God, and God reflects upon thoſe thoughts with an eye of love. <hi>Iſa. 38.. 5. I have heard thy prayers, I have ſeene thy teares.</hi> Tears we look upon but as poor things, and yet God looks upon them as Pearles, and therefore he <hi>puts them into</hi>
               <note place="margin">So in <hi>Pſ.</hi> 6. 8. One obſerves that there are 2 ſtrong things in Tears. 1 <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orſum fluunt, &amp; coelum te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt.</hi> They drop down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and fall to the earth, yet they teach up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and pierce the Pere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. 2 <hi>Muliae ſunt &amp; loquuntur.</hi> They hold their peace, yet cry very loud.</note> 
               <hi>his Bottle,</hi> as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks. There is not a bit of bread, nor a drop of drink thou giveſt, but God caſts an eye of love upon it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 35, 36.</p>
            <p>There is not a <hi>deſire</hi> that ariſes in thy ſoule, but the Lord takes notice of it. <hi>Prov. 10. 17. Thou haſt heard the deſire of the humble.</hi> Weak Saints are full of deſires, their whole life is a life of deſires, they are ſtil a breathing out holy deſires: Lord Pardon ſuch a ſin, and give me power againſt ſuch a ſin, and ſtrength Lord to withſtand ſuch a Temptation, and grace Lord to uphold me under ſuch an Affliction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:168177:51"/> the Lord hears and anſwers ſuch gracious breathings and longings.</p>
            <p>It was holy <hi>Jewell's</hi> deſire, <hi>That he might dye Preaching,</hi> and God lookt with an eye of love upon his deſire, and he had it.</p>
            <p>It was <hi>Latimer's</hi> deſire, <hi>That he might ſhed his heart blood for Chriſt,</hi> and God lookt with an eye of love upon the breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his heart, and he had it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did but groan, and God lookt upon their groans with an eye of love, he comes downe, he makes his Arme bare, he tramples upon their proud Enemies, and by Miracles he ſaves them. O weak Chriſtian! Is not this a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular comfort, that the Lord reflects with an eye of love up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your thoughts, upon your deſires, upon your tears, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your groanings? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What though others ſlight you? what though others take no notice of you? yet the Lord caſts an eye of love upon you.</p>
            <p>Some think its very ſtrange that God ſhould ſet downe in Scripture, the ſtory of <hi>Jacob,</hi> a poor Countrey-man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. that he had a few Ewes and Lambs, ſtreaked and ſpotted, and yet take no notice of the great Emperours and Kings of the Earth, nor of their great actions, and Warlike deſignes in the world. But this is to ſhew that tender love and reſpect that God bears to his Children, above what he does to the great ones of this World. <hi>God is more taken with Lazarus patcht Coat, then with Dives ſilken Robe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>A third thing that I ſhall propound for the Support and Comfort of weak Saints, is this.</p>
            <q>Conſider, the Lord looks more upon your Graces, then he
<note place="margin">3 Support:</note> doth upon your weakneſſes.</q>
            <p>Or thus:</p>
            <q>The Lord will not caſt away weake Saints, by reaſon of the weakneſſes that cleaves to their perſons, or ſervices.</q>
            <p>In 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 18, 19, 20. there came a multitude of people to eat the Paſſeover, but they were not prepared <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the preparation of the Sanctuary;</hi> therefore <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> puts up a Prayer for them, and the Text ſaith, <hi>That the Lord hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:168177:52"/> lookt upon their uprightneſſe, and ſo paſt over all their other weakneſſes. He did not caſt off <hi>Peter</hi> for his horrid ſins, but rather looks upon him with an eye of love and pity. <hi>Mark 16. 7. But goe your way, tell his Diſciples and Peter, that he goeth before you into Galilee, there ſhall ye ſee him, as he ſaid unto you.</hi> Oh admirable love! Oh matchleſſe mercy! where ſin abounds, grace do's ſuper-abound. This is the glory of Chriſt, that he carries it ſweetly towards his people, when they carry themſelves unworthily towards him. Chriſt looks more upon <hi>Peters</hi> ſorrow, then upon his ſin; upon his tears, then upon his Oaths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Lord will not caſt away weake Saints for their great unbeliefe, becauſe there is a little faith in them. He will not throw them away for that hypocrifie that's in them, becauſe of that (little) ſincerity that's in them. He will not caſt away weak Saints for that Pride that's in them, becauſe of thoſe Rayes of humility that ſhine in them. He will not deſpiſe his people for their paſſions, becauſe of thoſe graines of meekneſſe that are in them. We will not throw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a little gold becauſe of a great deale of droſſe that cleaves to it; nor a little wheat, becauſe mixt with much chaffe; and will God? will God?</p>
            <p>We will not caſt away our Garments, becauſe of ſome ſpots, nor our Books, becauſe of ſom blots; nor our Jewels, becauſe of ſome flawes; and do we think that the Lord will caſt away his deareſt ones, becauſe of their ſpots, and blots, and flawes? Surely no, God looks more upon the bright ſide of the Cloud, then the dark, <hi>James 5. 11. Remember the patience of Job,</hi> 'Tis not, Remember the murmuring of <hi>Job,</hi> the curſing of <hi>Job,</hi> the complainings of <hi>Job,</hi> the impatience of <hi>Job;</hi> but, <hi>Remember the patience of Job.</hi> God looks upon the Pearle, and not upon the ſpot that is in it. So in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 30, 31. there's mention made of <hi>Rahabs</hi> faith, love, and peaceable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour towards the Spies, but no mention made of her lye: the Lord overlooks her weakneſſe, and keeps his eye upon her virtues. Where God ſees but a little grace, he doth as it were hide his eyes from thoſe circumſtances that might ſeem to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face the glory of it. So in 1 <hi>Pet. 3. 6. Even as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him Lord.</hi> Mark, there was but one good
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:168177:52"/> word in <hi>Sarahs</hi> ſpeech, to <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſhe call'd her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band <hi>Lord,</hi> the ſpeech otherwiſe was a ſpeech of unbeliefe, yet the holy Ghoſt ſpeaking of her in reference to that ſpeech, conceales all the evill in it, and mentions onely the reverent title ſhe gave to her Husband, commending her for it.</p>
            <p>He that drew <hi>Alexander,</hi> whilſt he had a ſcar upon his face, drew him with his finger upon the ſcar: So when the Lord comes to look upon a poore ſoule, he layes his finger upon the ſcar, upon the infirmity, that he may ſee nothing but grace, which is the beauty and the glory of the ſoule. Ah but weak Chriſtians are more apt to look upon their infirmities, then on their graces; and becauſe their little gold is mixt with a great deale of droſſe, they are ready to throw away all as droſſe. Well, remember this, the Lord Jeſus hath as great, and as large an intereſt in the weakeſt Saints, as he hath in the ſtrongeſt. He hath the intereſt of a Friend, and the intereſt of a Father, and the intereſt of a Head, and the intereſt of a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; and therefore though Saints be weak, yea, though they be very weak, yet having as great, and as large an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in them, as in the ſtrongeſt Saints, he can't but overlook their weakneſſe, and keep a fixed eye upon their graces.</p>

His honour, his faithſulneſſe, and his goodneſſe is engaged in it, and therefore he cannot but doe it; elſe he would looſe much love and many prayers and praiſes, did he not cheriſh, preſerve, and ſtrengthen his owne work in his owne people.

The Genuine ſence of the ſimilitude I think is this, when a Vine being blaſted, or otherwiſe decayed, is growne ſo bad, and ſo barren, that ſcarce any good Cluſters of Grapes can be diſcerned on it, whereby it may be deemed to have any life, or of ever becoming fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful againe, and the Husband-man is about to grub it up, or cut it downe to the ground: One ſtanding by, ſees here a clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and there a little cluſter, and cryes out, O don't grub up the Vine, don't cut downe the Vine, it ha's a little life, and by good Husbandry it may be made fruitfull.

               <hi>Chriſt will not carry it roughly and rigorouſly, towards poore, weake, tender ſoules, whoſe Graces are as a bruiſed reed, and as ſmoaking flax.</hi> A Reed is a contemptible thing, a tender thing, it will break ſometimes before a man is aware; a bruiſed Reed is more tender, it will be broken with a touch; yet Chriſt will not breat ſuch a bruiſed Reed, <hi>i. e.</hi> a ſoule weak in grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nor quench the ſmoaking flax.</hi> The wick of a Candle is little worth, and yet leſſe when it ſmoakes, as yielding neither light nor heat, but rather ſmoakes and offends with an ill ſmel, which men cannot bear, but will tread it out. But the Lord Jeſus Chriſt will not doe ſo.

            <p>Firſt, <hi>Sin is ſlaine Judicially;</hi> for 'tis condemned both by Chriſt, and his people, and ſo 'tis dead according to Law;
<note place="margin">A three-fold death of ſin.</note> which is and may be a ſingular Comfort, and Support to weak Saints, that their greateſt and worſt Enemy (Sin) is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

               </note> The Apoſtle here triumphs over it, as a Thief condemned to death. Sin is ſentenc'd now, though not fully put to death, it's dead judicially. As when the ſentence of death is paſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Malefactor, you ſay he is a dead man, why? he is judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially dead: ſo is ſin, ſin is judicially dead. When a man that hath robbed and wounded another, is taken, and ſentenc'd judicially, we ſay <hi>he is a dead man;</hi> and it's often a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing and ſatisfaction to a man, that he is ſo. Sin, O weak ſoule! is ſentenc'd, and judicially ſlaine; and therefore that can never work the Lord Jeſus to give thee a Bill of Divorce. The thoughts of which ſhould much refreſh thee, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port thee.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Sin is dead or ſlaine civilly,</hi> as well as judicially. 'Tis civilly dead, becauſe the power of it is much abated; and
<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 14.</note> its Dominion and Tyranny over-powred; as when a King or a Tyrant is whipt and ſtript of all power to domineere, reigne,
<note place="margin">'Tis with ſin in the Saints, as 'twas with thoſe Beaſts, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 12. who had their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions taken away, though their lives were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed for a ſeaſon, and a time.</note> and play the Tyrant, is civilly dead, even whiles he lives: So is ſin in this ſenſe dead, even while it lives.

            </p>
            <p>What's the meaning of theſe words? The meaning is this, When the King of <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſpake, the people even trembled at his voyce, ſuch power once he had: But when he offended in <hi>Baal,</hi> by ſerving <hi>Baal,</hi> by giving himſelfe up to Idolatry, he dyed in reſpect of obedience, not yielded to him as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Time was that he was terrible, but when he fell to Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, his ſtrength and glory came downe; ſo that now he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came even like a dead Carcaſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adam</hi> dyed civilly, the ſame day that he ſinned: The Creatures that before lovingly obeyed him, as ſoon as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc't obedience to his God, they renounc't all obedience to him, or his Soveraignty; ſo that he civilly dyed the very ſame day that he ſinned.</p>
            <pb n="91" facs="tcp:168177:58"/>
            <p>That's a ſweet word that you have, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 11. <hi>Likewiſe reckon ye alſo your ſelves to be dead indeed unto ſin.</hi> Therefore Chriſt will never Divorce you for ſin. O what a ſupport may this be to a weak Saint! That ſin that he fears above all other
<note place="margin">Where ſinne ſits in the ſoule as a King ſins up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his throne and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the heart, as a King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands his ſubjects, there is reigne of ſin, but grace frees the ſoule from this.</note> things in the world, is ſlaine judicially and civilly; the Lord hath whipt and ſtript it of all its ruling, reigning, domineering, tyrannizing power. O therefore Chriſtians, look upon ſin as dead (that is) as not to be obeyed, as not to be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, no more then a Tyrant, that's ſtript of all his tyrannizing power. People that are wiſe, and underſtand their liberty, look not upon ſuch a one as fit to be obeyed and ſerved, but as one fit to be renounced, and deſtroyed. Doe you ſo look upon your ſins, and deale accordingly with them?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Sin is ſlaine Naturally,</hi> as well as Civilly; Chriſt hath given it its deaths wound, by his death, and reſurrection. He hath given ſin ſuch a wound, that it cannot be long liv'd, though it may linger a while in a Saint, (as a Tree that's cut at the root with a ſore gaſh, or two, muſt dye within a year, perhaps a month, nay, it may be within a week, though for a time it may flouriſh, it may have leaves and fruit, yet it ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dies, and will very ſhortly wither and periſh.) The Lord Jeſus hath given ſin ſuch a mortall wound, by his death and Spirit, and by the communication of his favour and grace to the ſoule, that ſin ſhall never recover its ſtrength more, but dye a lingring death, in the ſoules of the Saints. Chriſt did not dye all at once upon the Croſſe, but by little and little. To ſhew us, that his death ſhould extend to the ſlaying of ſin gradically, in the ſoules of the Saints. When our Enemy hath a mortall wound, we ſay, <hi>he is a dead man, his wound is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall:</hi> So when Jeſus Chriſt hath given ſin ſuch a deadly wound ſuch a mortall blow, that it ſhall never recover its ſtrength and power more; we may truly ſay, <hi>'Tis dead, 'tis ſlaine:</hi> Therefore cheere up, Oh weak ſoules, for certainly ſin that is thus ſlaine, can never provoke Jeſus Chriſt to give you a Bill of Divorce.

            <p>Know this weak Saints, for your ſupport and comfort, <hi>That Chriſt ſhares with you, and you ſhare with Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall open this ſweet Truth to you a little.</p>

            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>For verily he tooke not on him the Nature of Angels, but he tooke on him the ſeed of Abraham.</hi> And by this he hath advanc't fallen man, above the very Angels. This is the great Myſterie ſpoken of, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>And without controverſie, great is the Myſterie of Godlineſſe, God manifeſted in the fleſh,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>The Lord Jeſus ſhares with you in your Afflictions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 9. <hi>In all their afflictions he was afflicted, and the Angel of his preſence ſaved them. In his love, and in his pitty he redeemed them, and he bare them and carried them all the dayes of old.</hi> It is between Chriſt and his Church, as between two Lute-ſtrings, no ſooner one is ſtruck, but the other trembles.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>He ſhares with you in all your ſufferings, and perſecutions, as well as in all your afflictions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 4, 5. <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> There is ſuch a neer Union between the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the weakeſt Saints, that a man cannot ſtrike a Saint, but he muſt ſtrike through the very heart of Chriſt: Their ſufferings are held his, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 24. and their afflictions are his afflictions; and their reproaches are his reproaches, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 13. and their provocations are his provocations. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 4. 4, 5. God is provokt more then <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 18. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>Behold I, and the Children whom the Lord hath given me, are for ſignes and wonders in Iſrael.</hi> This the Apoſtle applies to Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 13.</p>
            <p n="4">4 <hi>The Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhares with you in all your Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> Heb. 2. 17, 18. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 15, 16.</p>
            <p>Chriſt was tempted, and he was afflicted, as well as you, that he might he able to ſuccour you that are tempted. As a poore man that ha's been troubled with paine and griefe, he will ſhare with others that are troubled with paine or grief.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:168177:59"/> Ah friends! the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath loſt none of his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, by going to Heaven; he is ſtill full of compaſſion, though free from perſonall paſſion. When he was on earth, Oh! how did he ſimpathize with his poor ſervants, in all their temptations. <hi>Satan</hi> (ſayes Chriſt to <hi>Peter) hath deſired to winnow thee, but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith faile not. Luther</hi> in his Preaching, met with every mans temptation, and being once askt <hi>How he could doe ſo?</hi> anſwered, <hi>Mine owne manifold temptations and experiences are the cauſe thereof.</hi> Oh the manifold temptations that the Lord Jeſus hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone, makes him ſemable (as I may ſay) and willing to ſhare with us in our temptations.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As Chriſt ſhares with weak Saints: So weak Saints ſhare with Chriſt. And this I ſhall ſhew you briefly in a few particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Weake Saints ſhare with Chriſt in his Divine Nature.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Whereby are given to us exceeding great and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Promiſes, that by theſe we might be partakers of the Divine</hi>
               <note place="margin">To be made partakers of the Divine Nature, notes two things. 1 Fellowſhip with God in his holineſſe. 2 A fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with God in his bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> 
               <hi>Nature.</hi> Not of the ſubſtance of the God-head, as the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliſts</hi> ſay, for that is incommunicable. But by the Divine Nature, we are to underſtand thoſe Divine Qualities, called elſwhere, <hi>The Image of God, the Life of God;</hi> that whereby we are made like to God in wiſedome, and holineſſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Image of God, after which man was at firſt Created, conſiſts, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 24. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 10. Saints that doe partake of this Divine Nature, that is, of thoſe Divine Qualities before ſpoken of, they reſemble God, not onely as a picture doth a man, in outward lineaments, but as a Child doth his Father, in countenance and condition. And well may grace be called, <hi>The Divine Nature;</hi> for as God bringeth light out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, comfort out of ſorrow, riches out of poverty, and glory out of ſhame: ſo does grace bring day out of night, and ſweet out of bitter, and plenty out of poverty, and glory out of ſhame. It turnes Counters into gold, Pebbles into Pearles, ſickneſſe into health, weakneſſe into ſtrength, and wants into abundance, <hi>Injoying nothing, and yet poſſeſſing all things,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Weake Saints ſhare with Chriſt in his Spirit and Grace.</hi>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:168177:60"/> In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 7. <hi>Chriſt is anointed with the Oyle of gladneſſe above his fellowes.</hi> They have the Anointings of the Spirit, as well as he, though not ſo richly as he.

               </note> the Lord Jeſus hath.

            <p>
               <hi>Grace for Grace:</hi> That is, as a Child in generation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives member for member: Or as the Paper from the Preſſe, receives letter for letter: Or as the Wax from the Seale, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives Print for Print: Or as the glaſſe from the Image, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives face for face: So does the weakeſt Saint receive from Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Grace for Grace:</hi> That is, for every grace that is in Chriſt, there is the ſame grace in us, in ſome meaſure. There is not the weakeſt Saint that breaths, but ha's in him ſome wiſedome that anſwers to the wiſedome of Chriſt; and ſome love, that anſwers to the love of Chriſt; and ſome humility, meekneſſe, and faith, that anſwers to the humility, meekneſſe, and faith, of the Lord Jeſus, in truth and reallity, though not in degree, or quantity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>

               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Duty.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Wilt thou be thankfull, Oh Chriſtian! for the leaſt cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie ſhewed thee by men? And wilt thou not be thankfull for that little meaſure of grace that is beſtowed upon thee by God? Doeſt thou remember, Oh weak Chriſtian! that the

               </note> leaſt meaſure of grace is more worth then a thouſand worlds? that 'tis more worth then heaven it ſelfe?

Doth free grace knock at thy doore, when it paſſes by the doores of thouſands? And doth it caſt a Pearl of price into thy boſome, when others are left to wallow in their blood for ever? And wilt thou not be thankfull? Oh doe but conſider, weak ſouls! how notoriouſly wicked you would have been, if the Lord had not beſtowed a little grace upon you. Thou lookeſt, oh ſoule! one way, and there thou heareſt ſome a curſing, ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and a blaſpheming God to his very face: Had not the Lord given thee a little grace, ten thouſand to one, but thou hadſt been one in wickedneſſe among theſe Monſters of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.

               <hi>That if he had all the world at his diſpoſe, he would give it all for one draught of Beer:</hi> So would an awakened conſcience, for one dram of grace. O ſaith ſuch a ſoule, when I look up, and ſee God frowning; when I look inward, and feele con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience gnawing, and accuſing; when I look downward, and ſee hell open to receive me; and when I look on my right and left hand, and ſee Devils ſtanding ready to accuſe me; O had I a thouſand worlds, I would give them all for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, lirtle drop of that grace that ſuch and ſuch ſoules have, whom I have formerly ſlighted and deſpiſed.

            <p>Well, remember one thing more, and that is this, <hi>viz. That there is no ſuch way to get much grace, as to be thankefull for a little grace.</hi> He who opens his mouth wide in praiſes, ſhall have his heart filled with graces. Ingratitude ſtops the ear of God, and ſhuts the hand of God, and turnes away the heart of the God of grace; and therefore you had need be thankfull for a little grace.

There's nothing that ſo clearly and ſo fully ſpeaks out your ſincerity and ſpirituall intenuity, as thankfullneſſe doth. Therefore weak Saints, if you would have a ſubſtantiall evidence of your ſincerity, and ſpirituall intenuity, be thankfull for a little grace.

In heaven there is no prayers, but all praiſes.

            <p>I, but weak Saints may ſay, <hi>Sir, We judge that there is weight in what you ſay, to provoke us to thankefullneſſe: But did we know that we had true Grace, though it were never ſo little, though it were but as the graine of Muſtard-ſeed, we would be thankefull. But this is our condition, we live be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene feares, and hopes; one day hoping we ſhall to heaven, and be happy for ever: Another day we are fearing that we ſhall to hell, and miſcarry for ever: And thus we are up and downe, backward and forward; ſometimes we believe we have grace, and at other times we doubt we have none.

            </p>
            <p>That man that lives not up to his grace, (let him be ſtrong or weak) wants one of the beſt and ſtrongeſt demonſtrations that can be, to evidence the truth of his grace. If you would have a clear evidence that that little love, that little faith, that little zeale you have, is true; then live up to that love, live up to that faith, live up to that zeale that you have, and this will evidence it beyond all contradiction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>You think becauſe of the weakneſſe of your grace, you muſt be borne with in this, and that, and what not? But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, it is your duty to live up to the light and grace you have; and nothing below this will effectually ſtop the mouths

Their light and knowledge tells them, that they ſhould be juſt and righteous in their dealings, and in all their wayes and deſignes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Though they have not ſuch great meaſures of ſpirituall injoyments, as ſuch and ſuch; yet that little grace they have, ſhould lead them b y the hand to

            <p>Let me a little expoſtulate the point with you (weak Saints) you know that you ſhould not be ſtirr'd and heated by every ſtraw that is in your way, why don't you in this then live up to your light?

               <hi>to thoſe that doe hurt to you;</hi> why doe not you in this live up to your light? You know that you ſhould doe your duties to others, though they neglect their duties to you: 'Tis not the neglect of a husbands duty, that frees the wife from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of hers: Nor the neglect of a wives duty, that frees the husband from the diſcharge of his. You know this, don't you? yes, why don't you then live up to your light? Why doe you by your contrary actings open the mouths of others againſt God, and his wayes? You know that you ſhould be exemplary in your relations, in your Generation, and in your converſations. You know that you ſhould be examples of holineſſe, meekneſſe, ſweetneſſe, patience, and contentedneſſe, and why then don't you live up to your knowledge in theſe things? You know that you ſhould doe to others, as you would have others to doe to you: And why in this don't you live up to your knowledge? Ah that you that are weak did not cauſe the mouths of wicked men to be opened againſt God, his truths, and wayes. Therefore by your living below that light and knowledge that God ha's given you, I beſeech you as you tender the honour of God, and as you would ſtop the mouths of vaine men, live up to thoſe meaſures of grace that the Lord ha's given you. No way to comfort-like this, no way to the Crowne like this; he will not be long a Babe in grace, who lives out that little grace he ha's.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Living up to your light is the readieſt and the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way to fetch up and to recover all that hath been loſt by your living below your light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By your living below your light, God, your owne ſoules, and the Goſpel, have loſt much, yea, and others alſo have loſt much light, comfort, ſtrength, and quickneſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that they

'tis not your running from Sermon to Sermon, (not that I ſpeak againſt frequent hearing of the word) nor your crying up this man, and that man; or this notion, or that; or this way, or that, that will recover and fetch up the honour that God hath loſt by your living below your graces; 'tis onely your living up to your graces, that will make up all the breaches that have been made upon his honour, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and upon the comfort and peace of your owne ſoules, and others. Well, remember this, all the honour that God hath from you in this life, is from your living up to that light, knowledge, love, feare, and faith, that he ha's given you: There's nothing that will make up all loſſes, but this; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I begg of you upon the knees of my ſoule, that you would take this one thing home with you, and goe into your Cloſets, and lay your hands upon your hearts, and ſay, <hi>Well, the Lord hath loſt much, and my owne ſoule hath loſt much, and others have loſt much by my living below that little Grace I have; and therefore I will now make it my buſineſſe (by aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace) to live up to thoſe meaſures of Grace that I have received, more then yet I have done all my dayes.

               <hi>way to get more Grace, is to live up to that little Grace you have.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that lives up to a little light, ſhall have more light; he that lives up to a little knowledge, ſhall have more knowledge; he that lives up to a little faith, ſhall have more faith; and he that lives up to a little love, ſhall have more love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There is no ſuch way to attaine to greater meaſures of grace, as for a man to live up to that little grace he hath. Verily the maine reaſon why many are ſuch Babes and ſhrubs in grace, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they don't live up to their attainments. He that won't
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:168177:67"/> improve two Talents, ſhall never have the honour to be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with five: But he that improves a little, ſhall be truſted with much. <hi>The diligent hand maketh rich.</hi> He that is active and agile, that works as well as wiſhes, that adds endeavours to his deſires, will quickly be a Cedar in grace. Ah Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans! you have a God that's great, a God that's good; a God that's gracious, and a God that is rich, that loves not to ſee his Children to be alwayes weaklings and ſtriplings in grace. The very Babe, by drawing the Breaſts, gets ſtrength and nouriſhment. O you Babes in grace, put out that little ſtrength you have, be you ſtill a drawing at the breaſts of Chriſt, at the breaſts of the Promiſes, and ſtrength will come, nouriſhment will follow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third Duty that I would preſſe upon weake Saints; is this.</p>
            <q>Be ſure that you alwayes reflect upon your Graces, and whatſocver good is in you, with Cautions.</q>
            <p>This is a weighty Point, and doth beſpeak your moſt ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous attention.</p>
            <p>There are ſix Rules or Cautions that weak Saints ſhould
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3 Duty."/> alwayes obſerve in their looking upon their graces.</p>
            <p>And the firſt is this, <hi>Looke upon all your Graces, as gifts</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Of thine owne</hi> (aith <hi>David) have we given thee.</hi> 1 Chr. 29. 14.</note> 
               <hi>of Grace; as favours given you from above, as gifts dropt out of heaven into your hearts, as flowers that are given you out of the Garden of Paradiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A man ſhould never look upon his grace, but he ſhould look upon it as a flower of Paradiſe, as a gift that God hath caſt into his boſome, from heaven. 1. <hi>Cor. 4. 7. Who maketh thee to differ from another? And what haſt thou that thou haſt not received?</hi> &amp;c. Thou talkeſt of light, of love, of fear, of faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but what are all theſe, but Pearles of glory that are freely given thee by the hand of grace? <hi>Every good</hi>
               <note place="margin">As all light flowes from the Sun, and all water from the ſea, ſo all good flowes from Heaven.</note> 
               <hi>and perfect gift comes downe from above.</hi> The greateſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies in us doe as much depend upon God, as the light doth upon the Sun. When thou lookeſt upon thy wiſedome, thou muſt ſay, Here's wiſedome, I, but 'tis from above. Here is ſome weak love working towards Chriſt, but 'tis from above Here's joy, and comfort, and peace, but theſe are all the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:168177:68"/> of Paradiſe, they never grew in natures Garden. When a ſoule looks thus upon all thoſe coſtly Diamonds with which his heart is deckt, he keeps low, though his graces are high. Where this rule is neglected, the ſoule will be endangered, of being ſwell'd and pufft.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> was uſed to ſay, <hi>That as he got much good by his ſins, ſo he got much hurt by his graces.</hi> When you look upon the ſtream, remember the fountaine; when you look upon the flower, remember the root; when you look upon the ſtars, remember the Sun; and when you look upon your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, remember the fountaine of grace, elſe Satan will be too hard for you. Satan is ſo artificiall, ſo ſubtill and critical, that he can make your very graces, to ſerve him againſt your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; conquering joy by joy, ſorrow by ſorrow, humility by humility, fear by fear, and love by love, if you doe not look upon all your graces, as ſtreames flowing from the fountaine above, and as fruits growing upon the Tree of life, that is in the midſt of the Paradice of God. Therefore when one eye is fixt upon your graces, let the other be alwayes fixt upon the God of grace.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pauls</hi> eye was upon his grace, <hi>Rom. 7. 22. 25. I delight in the Law of God, after the inward man. And with my mind I ſerve the Law of God.</hi> And yet at that very ſame time, his heart was ſet upon Chriſt, and taken up with Chriſt, <hi>verſ. 25. I thanke God, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> So in <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 2, 3. you have one eye fixt upon grace, and at the ſame time the heart fixt upon Chriſt. <hi>That their hearts might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full aſſurance of underſtanding, to the acknowledgement of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of God, and of the father, and of Chriſt; in whom are hid all the treaſures of wiſedome and knowledge.</hi> His eye is upon grace, his heart is upon Chriſt. So in <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8. the Apoſtle hath his eye upon the excellent knowledge of Chriſt, but <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. his heart is ſet upon the righteouſheſſe of Chriſt. <hi>That I might be found in him, not having mine owne righteouſneſſe,</hi>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:168177:68"/> 
               <hi>which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of Chriſt, the righteouſneſſe which is of God by faith.</hi> Here you have his eye upon grace, and his heart upon Chriſt, in the very preſence of his grace. This is your glory, Chriſtians, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and ſight of all your graces, to ſee the free grace of Chriſt and his infinite, ſpotleſſe, matchleſſe, and glorious righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to be your ſureſt, ſweeteſt, higheſt, and choyceſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and refuge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peter</hi> was not well skill'd in this leſſon, and that was the very reaſon that he fell fowleſt, when his confidence was high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. Grace is a ring of gold, and Chriſt is the Pearle in that ring; and he that looks more upon the ring, then the Pearle that is in it, in the houre of temptation will certainly fall. When the wives eye is upon her Rings or Jewels, then her heart muſt be ſet upon her husband. When grace is in my eye, Chriſt muſt at that time be in my armes; yea, he muſt lye between my breaſts. <hi>Cant. 1. 13. My Beloved is as a bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of myrrhe, he ſhall lye all night between my breaſts.</hi> Chriſt (and not grace) muſt lye neereſt to a Chriſtians heart.</p>
            <p>A third thing is this, <hi>When you looke upon your grace, you muſt looke upon it as a beautifull Creature, that is begotten in</hi>

            </p>
            <p>You muſt rather bring your Graces to the Touch-ſtone, to try their truth; then to the ballance to weigh their meaſure. Many weak Chriſtians are weighing their graces, when they ſhould be a trying the truth of their graces, as if the quantity and meaſure of grace were more conſiderable, then the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and nature of grace; and this is that that keeps many weak Saints in a dark, doubting, queſtioning, and deſpairing condition; yea, this makes their lives a very hell.

            <p>Sixthly, and laſtly, <hi>When you looke upon your Graces, look that you doe not renounce and reject your Graces (ſeene in the light of the ſpirit) as a weake and worthleſſe evidence of your intereſt in Chriſt, and that happineſſe that comes by Chriſt.</hi>

            <p>But that this may ſtick, and work, be pleaſed to carry home with you theſe three things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Other precious Saints that are now triumphing in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, have pleaded their intereſt in Gods love, and hopes of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter life from Graces inherent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I'le onely point at thoſe Scriptures that ſpeak out this truth. 1 <hi>John 3. 14. Chap. 2. 3, 4. Job</hi> 23. 10, 11, 12. And the whole 31 Chapter of <hi>Job. Pſal. 119. 6. Iſa. 38. 2, 3. 2 Cor.</hi> 1. 12. All theſe Scriptures (with many others that

And ſurely to deny the fruit growing upon the Tree, to be an Evidence that the Tree is alive, is to me as unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, as it is abſurd. Certainly, 'tis one thing to judge by our graces, and another thing to truſt in our graces, to make a Saviour of our graces. There is a great deale of difference betwixt declaring and deſerving: And if this be not granted, it will follow, that the Apoſtle hath ſent us aſide to a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works, when he exhorts us to <hi>uſe all dilligence to make our Calling and Election ſure,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 5-10.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Carry home this with you, <hi>If Juſtification and Sanctification be both of them benefits of the Covenant of Grace, then to evidence the one by the other, is no wayes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, nor no turning aſide to a Covenant of works.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>But our Juſtification and Sanctification are both of them benefits and bleſſings of the Covenant of Grace.</q>
            <q>Ergo.</q>
            <p>In <hi>Jer. 33. 8. I will pardon all their iniquity, whereby they have ſinned againſt me</hi> (there's your Juſtification.) <hi>And I will cleanſe them from all their iniquity, whereby they have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt me.</hi> (There's your Sanctification) And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:168177:71"/> to evidence the one by the other, can be no wayes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, nor no turning aſide to a Covenant of works.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Carry home this with you, <hi>Whatever gift of God in man brings him within the compaſſe of Gods Promiſe of Eternall Mercy, that Gift muſt be an infallible evidence of ſalvation, and happineſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But ſuch are thoſe gifts mentioned in thoſe Scriptures that prove the firſt head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore they are infallible evidences of our ſalvation, and eternall happineſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confeſſe a man may have many great gifts, and yet none

But I ſay, whatever gift of God in man brings him within the compaſſe of Gods Promiſe of eternall mercy, that gift muſt be an infallible evidence of his happineſſe, and bleſſedneſſe.</p>
            <p>For the further clearing of this, I will inſtance in a gift of <hi>Waiting;</hi> where this gift is, it brings a man within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of Gods Promiſe of eternall mercy. And had a man (as in a deſerted ſtate it often falls out) nothing under heaven to ſhew for his happineſſe, but onely a waiting frame, this ought to bear him up from fainting and ſinking. When the ſoule ſaith, My ſun is ſet, my day is turned into night, my light into darkneſſe, and my rejoycing into mourning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oh!

All that I can ſay, is this, That God keeps me in a waiting frame, weeping and knocking at the door of mercy. Now I ſay, This waiting temper brings the ſoule within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of the Promiſe of Eternall mercy: And certainly ſuch a ſoule ſhall not miſcarry.

I will not deceive their expectation, and after all their waiting turne them off, and ſay, I have no mercy for you. Now I ſay, where this wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing temper is, which is all that many a poor ſoul hath to ſhew for everlaſting happineſſe and bleſſedneſſe, that ſoule ſhall never miſcarry. That God that doth maintaine and uphold the ſoule in this heavenly waiting frame, in the appointed ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will ſpeak life and love, mercy, and glory, to the waiting ſoule.</p>
            <p>And ſo I have done with the third Uſe, which was to ſtir you up to look upon your graces, with Cautions.</p>
            <p>The fourth Duty is</p>
            <q>To perſwade weake Saints not to turne aſide from the wayes of God, nor from the ſervice of God, becauſe of any hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4 Duty."/> or difficulties that they may meet with in his wayes, or ſervice.</q>
            <p>There is a very great aptneſſe in weak Saints, to take of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence almoſt at every thing, and to be diſcouraged by the leaſt oppoſition, affliction, and temptation, and ſo to turne aſide from the good old way. Now that no difficulties, nor hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips may turne you out of the way that is called holy, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſeriouſly of theſe few things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Conſider this, <hi>The Lord will ſweeten more and more his ſervices to you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He will make his work to be more and more eaſie to your ſoules; he will ſute thy burden to thy back, and thy work to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:168177:72"/> thy hand, O weak ſoule. Thou ſhalt find that his grace will be ſufficient to hold thee up, and carry thee on, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 9. 2 Cor. 5. 14.</note> any difficulties or diſcouragements that be in the way. He will ſhed abroad that love that ſhall conſtraine thy ſoule,
<note place="margin">The Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher told his friends when they came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his little low Cottage <hi>(Enteuthen ouk apeiſi the oi) the Gods are here with me.</hi> Surely God, and Chriſt, and the Spirit are and will be with weak Saints to aid and aſtiſt them in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gracious work.</note> both to keep cloſe to his ſervice, and to delight in his ſervice. He will make all his ſervices to be eaſie to thee; he will vouchſafe to thee that aſſiſting grace that ſhall keep up thy head and heart from fainting and ſinking under diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; as you may ſee in <hi>Ezek. 36. 25, 26, 27, 28. And I will put my ſpirit within you, and cauſe you to walke in my Statutes, and ye ſhall keepe my Judgements, and doe them.</hi> So in <hi>Pſal. 63. 8. My ſoule followeth hard after thee</hi> (I, but how comes this to paſſe?) <hi>Thy right hand upholds me.</hi> I feele thy hand under me, drawing of my ſoule off after thee. Oh! were not thy gracious hand under me, I ſhould never follow hard after thee. The Lord will put under his everlaſting armes, O weak Chriſtian, and therefore though thy feet be apt to ſlide, yet his everlaſting armes ſhall bear thee up; therefore be not diſcouraged, doe not turne aſide from thoſe paths that drop marrow and fatneſſe, though there be a Lyon in the way.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider this, O weak Saint, <hi>That there is leſſe danger and hardſhip in the wayes of Chriſt, then there is in the wayes of ſin, Satan, or the world.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 11. 18, 19. &amp; 21. 21.</note>
            </p>
            <p>That ſoule doth but leap out of the Frying-pan into the fire, that thinks to mend himſelfe by turning out of the way that is called holy. Oh! the horrid drudgery that is in the wayes of ſin, Satan, or the world. Thy worſt day in Chriſts ſervice, is better then thy beſt dayes (if I may ſo ſpeak) in ſin or Satans ſervice. Satan will pay the ſinner home at laſt with the loſſe of God, Chriſt, Heaven, and his ſoule for ever: But <hi>in the way of righteouſneſſe is life,</hi> joy, peace, honour, <hi>and in the path-way thereof there is no death,</hi> Prov. 12. 28. <hi>His wayes are wayes of pleaſantneſſe, and all his paths are peace,</hi> Prov. 3. 17.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Remember, O weak Saint, <hi>That all thoſe hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips that thou meeteſt with, doe onely reach the outward man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They onely reach the ignoble, the baſer part of man; they
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:168177:72"/> meddle not, they touch not the noble part. <hi>With my mind I ſerve the Law of God, though with my fleſh the Law of ſin,</hi> Rom. 7. 22. And, <hi>verſ. 25. I delight in the Law of God, after the inward man.</hi> And indeed, many of the Heathen have incouraged themſelves for this very conſideration, againſt the troubles and dangers of this life. All the Arrowes that are
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anaxagoras, Pla to,</hi> and others.</note> ſhot at a Chriſtian, ſtick in his Buckler, they never reach his conſcience, his ſoule. The raging waves beat ſorely againſt <hi>Noah's</hi> Ark, but they toucht not him. The ſoule is of too noble a nature to be toucht by troubles. <hi>Jacob's</hi> hard ſervice under <hi>Laban,</hi> and his being nipt by the froſt in winter, and
<note place="margin">Gen. 31. 40.</note> ſcorcht by the Sun in ſummer, did onely reach his outward man; his ſoule had high communion, and ſweet fellowſhip with God, under all his hardſhips. Ah Chriſtian! bear up bravely, for whatever hardſhips thou meeteſt with in the wayes of God, ſhall onely reach thy outward man; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all theſe hardſhips thou mayeſt have as high and ſweet
<note place="margin">Hoſ. 2. 14.</note> communion with God, as if thou hadſt never knowne what hardſhips meant.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Tell me, O weake Saints, have not you formerly injoyed ſuch ſweet refreſhings while you have been in the very ſervice of God, as hath out-wayed all the troubles and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips that your ſoules have met with?</hi> I know you have, and you know that you have often found that Scripture made good upon your hearts, <hi>Pſal. 19. 11. Moreover by them is thy ſervant warned, and in keeping of them there is great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi> (Mark) he doth not ſay, <hi>For keeping of them there is great reward,</hi> though that's a truth: But <hi>in keeping</hi>

               <hi>of them there is great reward.</hi> While the ſoule is at work, God throwes in the reward. Don't you remember, O weak Chriſtians, when you have been in the ſervice and way of God, how he hath caſt in joy at one time, and peace at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Oh! the ſmiles, the kiſſes, the ſweet diſcoveries that your ſoules have met with, whilſt you have been in his wayes. Ah poore ſoules! don't you know, that one houres being in the boſome of Chriſt, will make you forget all your hardſhips? heaven at laſt will make amends for all; and the more hardſhips you find in the wayes of God, the more
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:168177:73"/> ſweet will heaven be to you, when you come there. O how ſweet is a Harbour after a long ſtorme; and a Sun-ſhine day after a dark and tempeſtuous night, and a warme Spring, after a ſharp winter. The miſeries and difficulties that a man meets with in this world, will exceedingly ſweeten the glory of that other world.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Conſider, <hi>What hardſhips and difficulties the men of this world run through, to get the world, and undoe their owne ſoules.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They riſe early, goe to bed late, they goe from one end of the world, to another, and venture through all manner of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,

<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 3, 4.</note> for the honour of thy Captaine, and thine owne internall and eternall good? Thou art liſted under Chriſts Colours, and therefore thou muſt arme thy ſelfe againſt all difficulties, and diſcouragements. The number of difficulties makes the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians Conqueſt the more illuſtrious. A gracious man ſhould be made up all of fire, overcoming and conſuming all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,
<note place="margin">As <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaid of <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </note> as fire does the ſtubble. All difficulties ſhould be but whet-ſtones to his fortitude.</p>
            <q>The fifth Duty is this, <hi>You that are weake Saints ſhould obſerve how Chriſt keepes your wills and affections.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5 Duty."/>
            </q>
            <p>That man is kept indeed, whoſe will and affection is kept cloſe to Chriſt: And that man is loſt with a witneſſe, whoſe will and affections are won from Chriſt. Weak Saints are more apt to obſerve their owne actions, then their wills and affections, and this proves a ſnare unto them; therefore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve your affections, how they are kept, for if they are kept cloſe to Chriſt, if they are kept faithfull to Chriſt, (though thy foot may ſlide from Chriſt) all is well. The Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. obſerv'd that his will and affections were kept cloſe to Chriſt, even then when he was Tyrannically Captivated, and carried by the prevalency of ſin, from Chriſt. <hi>With my mind I ſerve the Law of God</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>and what I doe I allow not, therefore it is no more I that doth it, but ſin that dwelleth in me.</hi> My will ſtands cloſe to Chriſt, and my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:168177:73"/> are faithfull to Chriſt, though by the prevalency of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption I am now and then carried Captive from Chriſt. 'Tis one thing to be taken up by an Enemy, and another thing for a man to lay downe his Weapons at his Enemies feet. I am, ſaith the Apoſtle, a forc't man, <hi>I doe what I hate,</hi> I doe what I never intended. The heart may be ſound, when more exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and inferiour parts are not. The heart of a man may be ſound God-ward, and Chriſt-ward, and holineſſe-ward, when yet there may be many defects, and weakneſſes in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. Now a weak Chriſtian ſhould be very ſtudious to obſerve how his heart ſtands God-wards; for the man is as his heart is, if that be right with Chriſt, then all is well; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſayes <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 4. 23. <hi>Keep thy heart with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, for out of it are the iſſues of life.</hi> The Hebrew runs more
<note place="margin">The heart is <hi>(Camera om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentis Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis) The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence-Chamber of the King of Heaven.</hi>
               </note> fully thus, <hi>Before all,</hi> or <hi>Above all keepings, keepe thy heart;</hi> for out of it is the goings forth of lives. The heart is the Spring and Fountaine of all naturall and ſpirituall actions; 'tis the <hi>Primum mobile,</hi> the great wheele that ſets all other wheeles a going: 'Tis the great Monarch in the Iſle of Man, therefore keep it with all cuſtody and Caution, or elſe bid farewell to all true joy, peace, and comfort. When the heart ſtands right towards Chriſt, Chriſt will pardon much, and paſſe by much.</p>
            <p>If the raviſhed Virgin in the time of the Law cryed out, ſhe was guiltleſſe: So when a poore ſoule, raviſhed by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of corruption, and ſtrength of Satans temptations, cryes out, Lord I would not for all the world, ſin againſt thee; I would not diſtruſt thee; I would not be impatient under thy afflicting hand; I would not be proud, under thy mercifull hand; but Lord, theſe <hi>Sons of Zerviah,</hi> theſe corruptions,
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 3. 39.</note> 
               <hi>are too hard for me;</hi> they commit a Rape upon me, they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh me of my Jeſus, and of my joy, and of my peace; Lord help me, Lord deliver me. Now theſe weakneſſes ſhall not be charged upon the ſoule. The raviſhed Virgin under the Law, if ſhe cryed out, was guiltleſſe: And certainly, God is not, nor will not be leſſe mercifull and gracious to his people under the Goſpel, who are ſtill a crying out againſt their ſins, and Satans aſſaults. Surely thoſe ſins ſhall never be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:168177:74"/> bane, that are now his greateſt burden. 'Tis not falling into the water, but lying in the water, that drownes. 'Tis not falling into ſin, but lying in ſin, that damnes. If ſin and thy heart be two, Chriſt and thy heart are one. If thy heart be Chriſt-ward, thou art ſo happy that nothing can make thee miſerable.</p>
            <p>Sixthly,</p>
            <q>Take heed of making ſenſe and feeling a Judge of your
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6 Duty."/> condition.</q>
            <p>Though there is nothing more dangerous, yet there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more ordinary, then for weak Saints to make their ſenſe and feeling the Judge of their condition. Ah poore ſoules! this is diſhonourable to God, and very diſadvantagious to

               </note> your ſelves. Senſe is ſometimes oppoſite to reaſon, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to faith; therefore doe as thoſe Worthies did, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 8, 9. We walke by faith, and not by ſight.</hi> For a man to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue thus, Surely God is not my God, for I am not inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I am not quickned, I am not melted, I am not raiſed, I am not inlarged as formerly: Oh! I have not thoſe ſweet anſwers and returnes of Prayer, that once I had. Oh! I can't find the Lords quickning preſence, nor his inlivening preſence, nor his humbling preſence, nor his incouraging pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, as once I have; therefore ſurely my condition is not good. Oh! I am more backward to good, then formerly; and more prone to evill, then formerly; therefore I am afraid that God is not my God, and that the work of grace is not through upon me. Oh! God does not look upon me as in the dayes of old; nor ſpeak to me, as in the dayes of old; nor carry it towards me, as in the dayes of old; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am afraid that all is naught.</p>
            <p>Verily, if you will make ſenſe and feeling the Judge of your eſtate and condition, you will never have peace nor comfort all your dayes. Thy eſtate, O Chriſtian, may be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good, when ſenſe and feeling ſayes 'tis very bad. That Child cannot but be perplexed, that thinks his father doth not love him, becauſe he does not alwayes feele him ſmoothing and ſtroking of him. Chriſtians, you muſt remember, that 'tis one thing for God to love you; and another thing for
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:168177:74"/> God to tell you that he loves you. Your happineſſe lyes in

The Counſel that I would give to ſuch a ſoule that is apt to ſet up reaſon in the roome of faith, is this, <hi>Whatſoever thy eſtate and condition be, never make ſenſe and feeling the Judge of it, but onely the word of God.</hi> Did ever God appoint carnall reaſon, ſenſe, and feeling, to be a Judge of thy eſtate? Surely no: And why then wilt thou ſubject thy ſoule to their judgement? God will judge thee at laſt by his word, <hi>John 12. 48. The word that I have ſpoken, the ſame ſhall judge you in the laſt day.</hi> Carnall reaſon is an Enemy to faith, 'tis ſtill a croſſing and contradicting of faith; it fills the mind full of cavills and prejudices, full of Pleas and Arguments to keep Chriſt and the ſoule aſunder; and the ſoule and the Promiſes aſunder; and the ſoule and peace and comfort aſunder. 'Twill never be well with thee, ſo long as thou art ſwayed by carnall reaſon, and relyeſt more upon thy five Senſes, then the foure Evangeliſts. Remember, <hi>Job</hi> was as famous for his Confidence, as for his Patience. <hi>Though he ſlay me, yet will I truſt in him,</hi> Job 13. 15. As the body lives by breathing, ſo the ſoule lives by believing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>And the firſt is this,</p>

               <p>

Well, ſaith he, ſeeing it is ſo, that thou wilt not believe, I will rather bleed afreſh, then thou ſhalt dye in thy unbeliefe. So the three Diſciples that Chriſt had ſingled out to watch with him one houre, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. they ſhewed a great deale of weakneſſe to be ſleeping, when their Lord was a ſorrowing; to be ſnorting, when their Saviour was ſighing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet Chriſt bears this, and carries it ſweetly towards them, and excuſes their weakneſſe, <hi>verſ. 41. The ſpirit is willing, but the fleſh is weake.</hi> Oh how ſweetly doth the Lord carry it! Every new man is two men, he hath a contrary principle in him; the fleſh, and the ſpirit: The ſpirit, the Noble part is willing; but the fleſh, the ignoble part, is weak, and way-ward.</p>
               <p>Now ſhall the Lord thus bear with his weak ones, and ſhall not ſtrong Saints bear alſo? Remember ſtrong Chriſtians, there was a day when you were as weak as others; as apt to fall, as others; as eaſily conquered, as others; and if then the Lord carried it ſweetly towards you, let the ſame ſpirit be in you, towards thoſe that are weak; it will be no grief of heart to you, if in this you act like your Lord and Saviour.</p>
               <p>If you doe not bear with the infirmities of the weak, who ſhall? who will? this wicked world cannot, nor will not:
<note place="margin">Iſa. 29. 21. Jer. 20. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>The world will make them tranſgreſſors for a word, and watch for their halting:</hi> And therefore you had need to bear with them ſo much the more; the worlds cruelty ſhould ſtir up your compaſſions.</p>
               <p>Secondly,</p>
               <q>As it is your duty to bear with them, ſo it is your duty to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2 Duty."/> receive them into communion with you.</q>
               <p>Rom. 14. 1. <hi>Him that is weake in the faith receive you, but not to doubtfull diſputations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Him that is weake in the faith receive:</hi> That is, him that is not throughly perſwaded of all things pertaining to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:168177:76"/> liberty, about things indifferent. <hi>Them that are weake in the faith receive.</hi> He doth not ſay, <hi>Them that have no faith receive:</hi> For there is no rule for the Saints or Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to receive them into Communion that have no faith, that have no fellowſhip with the father and the Son. But <hi>him that is weake in the faith,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>receive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The word that is here rendred <hi>Receive,</hi> ſignifies to receive
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Proſtambane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthe.</hi>
                  </note> into our boſome with charitable affection. The Greek word ſignifies three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1 It ſignifies to receive weak Saints as <hi>our owne bowels;</hi> to receive them with the greateſt tenderneſſe, affections, pity, and compaſſion that poſſibly can be. So the ſame Greek word is uſed in the Epiſtle of <hi>Philemon, verſ.</hi> 12. where <hi>Paul</hi> intreats <hi>Philemon, to receive Oneſimus as his owne bowels.</hi> The word there is the ſame word with this in the Text: So muſt the ſtrong receive the weak, even as their owne bowels; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them with the greateſt affection, with the greateſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion that poſſibly can be.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The word ſignifies <hi>patiently to bear with the weake when they are received:</hi> And not to take them into your boſomes, into your communion one day, and caſt them out the next, but patiently to bear with them, as well as affectionately to receive them.</p>
               <p>It was a Heathen Prince that Crowned his Steer-man in
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Xerxes."/> the morning, and beheaded him in the evening of the ſame day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 The word ſignifies <hi>by fatherly inſtruction to ſeeke to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore him.</hi> 'Tis not the will of Chriſt that weak Saints ſhould be rejected, or that the doore of entrance ſhould be ſhut againſt them, till they are ſtronger, or till they have attain'd to ſuch heights, and ſuch perfections of grace, and Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of God, as others have attain'd. Remember this, as the weakeſt faith (if true) gives the ſoule a right to all that internall and eternall worth that is in Chriſt: So the weakeſt faith, if true, gives a man a reall right unto all the externall priviledges and favours that come by Chriſt. In <hi>Rom. 15. 7. Wherefore receive ye one another, as Chriſt alſo received us to the glory of God.</hi> This is the ſtanding rule for
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:168177:76"/> all the Saints and Churches in the world to goe by: 'Tis not their wills, but theſe two Scriptures laſt cited, that are the ſtanding rules by which all the Churches on earth are to goe by, in the admiſſion of Members.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Them that are weake in the faith</hi> are to be received by you, becauſe the Lord Jeſus ha's received them. Chriſt does not receive the ſtrong to the glory of God, and caſt off the weak: No, the Lord Jeſus gathers the weak into his boſome, and tenderly dandles them upon his knee. He receives the weak to glory, as well as the ſtrong; therefore ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>As the Lord hath received them, ſo doe you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bucer</hi> ejected none, in whom he ſaw <hi>(Aliquid Chriſti) Any thing of Chriſt:</hi> But gave them the right hand of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip. Such perſons and Churches can never anſwer it to Chriſt, that keep the door of admiſſion ſhut againſt ſoules truly gracious, though they are but weak in grace, though they have not attain'd to ſuch a meaſure of light, or degrees of love, or to ſuch pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ections in holineſſe, as ſuch and ſuch have done: No, the ſtanding Rule is, <hi>Him whom the Lord hath received, receive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If weak Saints ſhall deſire communion, and be willing to walk in the wayes that Jeſus Chriſt hath appointed his Saints to walk in, the Churches ought to give them the right hand of fellowſhip. And that's the ſecond Duty that lyes upon the ſtrong, <hi>viz. That they are to receive the weake into commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and fellowſhip with them, and that with the greateſt affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, love, and compaſſion that poſſibly can be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A third Duty that lyes upon ſtrong Saints to the weak, is this.</p>
               <q>They muſt looke more upon their Graces, then upon their
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3 Duty,"/> weakneſſes.</q>
               <p>'Tis a ſad thing when they ſhall borrow Spectacles to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold their weak brethrens weakneſſes, and refuſe Looking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſſes wherein they may ſee their weak brethrens graces. Saints that are ſtrong, ought to look more upon the virtues of weak Saints, then upon their miſcarriages. When Chriſt ſaw but a little morall good in the young man, the Text ſaith, that <hi>he lookt upon him, and loved him:</hi> And ſhall not
<note place="margin">Mark 10. 12.</note>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:168177:77"/> we look upon a weak Saint, and love him, when we ſee the love of God, and the Image of God upon him? Shall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

And ſhall not ſupernaturall grace in a weak Chriſtian take our eyes, and draw our hearts? Shall we eye a little gold in much earth? And ſhall we not eye a little grace where there is much corruption.</p>
               <p>It is an inſufferable weakneſſe (I had almoſt ſaid) for perſons to ſuffer their affections to run out onely to ſuch that are of their judgements, and to love, prize, and value perſons according as they ſute their opinions, and not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what of the Image of God ſhines in them. But if this be not far from a Goſpel ſpirit, and from that God-like ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that ſhould be in the Saints, I know nothing. It ſpeaks out much of Chriſt within, to owne where Chriſt ownes, and love where Chriſt loves, and imbrace where Chriſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces, and to be one with every one that is practically one with the Lord Jeſus. Chriſt can't but take it very unkindly at our hands, if we ſhould diſowne any upon whom he ha's ſet his Royall ſtamp: And I bleſſe his grace that ha's drawne out my deſires and endeavours to love, owne, and honour the people of Chriſt, according to what of the appearances of Chriſt I ſee in them. And, if I am not much miſtaken, this is the high-way to that joy, peace, and comfort, the want of which makes many a mans life a hell. God looks more on the bright ſide of the Cloud, then he doth on the dark, and ſo ſhould we.</p>
               <p>It was the honour of <hi>Veſpatian, That he was more ready to conceale the Vices of his friends, then their virtues.</hi> Surely there is much of God in that ſoule, that is upon a Goſpel account more carefull and skillfull to conceale the vices of weak Saints, then their virtues. Many in theſe dayes doe juſtly incur the cenſure which that ſowre Philoſopher paſt

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly,</p>
               <q>It is the duty of ſtrong Saints, in things indifferent to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4 Duty."/> deny themſelves to pleaſe the weake.</q>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:168177:77"/>
               <p>1 <hi>Cor. 8. 13. Wherefore if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no fleſh while the world ſtandeth, leaſt I make my Brother to offend.</hi> Strong Saints muſt ſtand unchangeably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved neither to give offence careleſly, nor to take offence cauſleſly. Sayes the Apoſtle, I will not ſtand to diſpute my Chriſtian liberty, but will rather lay it downe at my weak brothers feet, then I will by the uſe of it offend one for whom Chriſt ha's dyed. 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 22. To the weake became I as weake, that I might gaine the weake. I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means ſave ſome.</hi> That is, I condeſcended and went to the uttermoſt that poſſibly I could (without ſin) to win and gaine upon the weak; I diſpleaſed my ſelfe in things that were of an indifferent nature, to pleaſe them. Thou oughteſt not, O ſtrong Chriſtian! by the uſe of thy Chriſtian liberty, to put a ſtumbling-block be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy weak Brother. <hi>Rom. 15. 2. We then that are ſtrong, ought to bear with the infirmities of the weake, and not to pleaſe our ſelves. Let every one of us pleaſe his neighbour for his good to edification.</hi> He doth not ſay, Let every one of us pleaſe the luſt of his neighbour, but let every one of us pleaſe his neighbour for his good to edification: Let us in things of an indifferent nature, ſo yield as to pleaſe our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. There were ſome that thought they might obſerve dayes, others thought they might not. Some thought they might eat meat, others thought they might onely eat Hearbs. Why, ſaith the Apoſtle, in theſe things that are of an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent nature, I will rather diſpleaſe and deny my ſelfe, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit my neighbour, then I will by the uſe of my liberty, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my neighbour to offend. I, this is true Chriſtian love in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, for a man to croſſe himſelfe to pleaſe his neighbour, ſo it may be for his ſoules edification: But this heavenly love is driven almoſt out of the world, which cauſeth men to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlike thoſe things in others, which they flatter in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>A fifth Duty incumbent upon ſtrong Saints, is</p>
               <q>To ſupport the weake.</q>
               <p>1 <hi>Theſſ. 5. 14. Support the weake, be patient towards all</hi>

Strong Saints muſt not deale by the weak, as the Herd of <hi>Deere</hi> doe by the wounded <hi>Deere,</hi> they forſake it, and puſh it away: O no, when a poor weak Saint is wounded by a temptation, or by the power of ſome corruption, then they that are ſtrong ought to ſuccour and ſupport ſuch a one, leaſt he be ſwallowed up of ſorrow. When you that are ſtrong ſee a weak Saint ſtaggering and reeling under a temptation, or affliction; Oh know, it's then your duty to put both your hands underneath, to ſupport him that he faint not, that he miſcarries not in ſuch an houre. <hi>Iſa. 35. 3. Strengthen ye the weake hands, and confirme the feeble knees. Strengthen the weake hands.</hi> That is, hands that hang downe. <hi>And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the feeble knees,</hi> that is, ſuch knees that by reaſon of fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe are ready to fall, ſtrengthen ſuch; that is, incourage them, by caſting in a Promiſe, by caſting in thy Experiences, or by caſting in thy Experiences of other Saints, that ſo they may be ſupported. It may be his caſe was once thine; if ſo, then tell him what Promiſes did ſupport thee, what diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of God did uphold thee: Tell him, what taſts, what ſights, and what incomes thou hadſt, and how bravely thou didſt bear up by the ſtrength of his everlaſting armes, that were under thee, <hi>&amp;c</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A ſixth Duty that is incumbent upon ſtrong Saints, is</p>
               <q>To take heed of making weake Saints halt and goe lame
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6 Duty."/> in a way of holineſſe, or of keeping them off from the ways of God, or of turning them out of the wayes of God.</q>
               <p>That's the meaning of that Scripture (as I conceive) <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 2. And of that, <hi>Mat. 18. 10 Take heed that ye offend not one of theſe little ones, for their Angels doe alwayes behold the face of my father.</hi> You are apt to ſlight them becauſe they are weak in grace and holineſſe, and ſo you are apt to cauſe them to halt, but take heed of this; they have glorious gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering Courtiers that doe attend them; therefore take heed
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:168177:78"/> that you don't offend them, for their Angels as ſo many Champions, ſtand ready to right them, and fight for them. A man were better offend and anger all the Devils in hell, and all the Witches in the world, then to anger and offend the leaſt of Chriſts little ones. If <hi>Caine</hi> doe but lower upon <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> God will arraigne him for it, <hi>Why is thy countenance caſt downe?</hi> If <hi>Miriam</hi> doe but mutter againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> God
<note place="margin">Num. 12 14.</note> will ſpit in her face for it. That is a very dreadfull word, <hi>Mat. 18. 6. Take heed how you offend one of theſe little ones,</hi> (you make nothing of it, but ſaith Chriſt, <hi>take heed) for it were better that a Mill-stone (A huge Mill-ſtone,</hi> as the Greek word ſignifies, ſuch a one as an Aſſe can but turne about: This kind of puniſhment the greateſt Malefactors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jewes were put to in thoſe dayes, ſaith <hi>Jerom) and he caſt into the middle of the ſea;</hi> ſo it is word for word in the Greek, the middle being deepeſt, and furtheſt off from the ſhore; rendring his eſtate moſt miſerable and irrecoverable.</p>
               <p>Seventhly,</p>
               <q>It is the Duty of ſtrong Saints to ſute all things to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7 Duty,"/> of the weake.</q>
               <p>To ſute all their prayers and all their diſcourſes to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of the weak. <hi>Paul</hi> was good at this, <hi>To the weake I became as weake: Paul</hi> he was a man as ſtrong in naturall and acquired parts, as any living, and he knew how to word it, and to carry it in as lofty ſtraines as any that breathed, yet who more plaine in his Preaching, then <hi>Paul?</hi> It hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a time made my heart ſad, to think how thoſe men will anſwer it in the day of Chriſt, that affect lofty ſtraines, high notions, and cloudy expreſſions, that make the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Many Preachers in our dayes are like <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> who was called <hi>The Darke Doctour,</hi> they affect ſublime notions, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure expreſſions, uncouth phraſes, making plaine truths diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, and eaſie truths hard. <hi>They darken councel with words without knowledge,</hi> Job 38. 2. Studdied expreſſions, and high notions in a Sermon, are like <hi>Aſahels</hi> Carkaſſe in the way, that did onely ſtop men, and make them gaze, but did no wayes profit them, or better them. 'Tis better to preſent
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:168177:79"/> truth in her native plainneſſe, then to hang her eares with counterfeit Pearles.</p>
               <p>That's a remarkeable Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 1, 2. And I bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, could not ſpeake unto you, as unto ſpirituall, but as unto carnall, even as unto Babes in Chriſt. I have fed you with milke, and not with meat, for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.</hi> The Apoſtle did not ſoare aloft in the Clouds, and expreſſe the Myſteries of the Goſpel in ſuch a dark obſcure way, as that poor Creatures could not be able to pick out the mind of God in it: No, but he ſuted all his diſcourſes to their capacities, and ſo muſt you.</p>
               <q>Eightly, <hi>It is your duty to labour to ſtrengthen weak Saints againſt ſin, and to draw them to holineſſe Argumentatively.</hi>

               <p>Now there is a three-fold Mantle that ſhould be caſt over the infirmities of the weak. There is a Mantle of <hi>Wiſedome.</hi>

It is more a weakneſſe then a virtue in ſtrong Chriſtians, when a weak Saint is fallen, to aggravate his fall to the uttermoſt, and to preſent his ſins in ſuch a dreadfull dreſſe, as ſhall amaze him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It often proves very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall and dangerous to weak Saints, when their infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are aggravated beyond Scripture-grounds, and beyond what they are able to beare. He that ſhall lay the ſame ſtrength to the rubbing of an earthen diſh, as he does to the rubbing of a Pewter platter, inſtead of cleaning it, ſhall ſurely break it all to pieces. The application is eaſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, There is a Mantle uf <hi>Faithfullneſſe</hi> that is to be caſt over the infirmities of weake Saints. A man ſhould never diſcover the infirmities of a weak Saint, eſpecially to ſuch that have neither skill, nor will to heale and bury them: The world will but blaſpheme, and blaze them abroad, to the diſhonour of God, to the reproach of Religion, and to the grief and ſcandall of the weak, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They will with <hi>Ham,</hi> rather call upon others to ſcoffe at them, then bring a Mantle to cover them, <hi>&amp;c. Ham</hi> was curſt for that he did diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his fathers nakedneſſe to his brethren, when it was in his
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:168177:80"/> power to have covered it; he ſaw it, and might have drawne a Curtaine over it, but would not; and for this, by a Spirit of Propheſie he was curſt by his father, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 22. This Age is full of ſuch Monſters, that rejoyce to blaze abroad the infirmities of the Saints, and theſe certainly Juſtice ha's or will curſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There is a Mantle of <hi>Compaſſion</hi> that muſt be

When a weak Saint comes to ſee his ſin, and the Lord gives him to lye downe in the duſt, and to take ſhame and confuſion to himſelfe, that he hath diſhonoured God, and cauſed Chriſt to bleed afreſh, and griev'd the Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oh now thou muſt draw a covering, and caſt a Mantle of love and compaſſion over his ſoule, that he may not be ſwallowed up with ſorrow; now thou muſt confirme thy love to him, and carry it with as great tenderneſſe and ſweetneſſe after his fall, as if he had never fallen; this the Apoſtle preſſes, 2 <hi>Cor. 2. 7. Love,</hi> ſayes the wiſe man, <hi>covereth all ſinne.</hi> Loves Mantle is very large: Love claps a Plaiſter upon every ſoare; Love ha's two hands, and makes uſe of both, to hide the ſcarres of weak Saints. Chriſt, O ſtrong Saints, caſts the Mantle of his righteouſneſſe over your weakneſſes, and will not you caſt the Mantle of love over your brothers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities?</p>

               </note> Greek word <hi>(Caris)</hi> that's here rendred <hi>Grace,</hi> hath a two-fold ſignification. Somtimes it's taken for the gracious favour and good will of God, whereby he is pleaſed of his owne free love to accept and owne poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the Son of his love, for his owne.

               <p>For the firſt, <hi>What are thoſe beſt gifts that Chriſt beſtowes upon his beſt beloved ones?</hi>
               </p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Repentance.</hi> Repentance is not a Flower that growes in Natures Garden. <hi>Acts 5. 31. Him hath God the father exalted, to be a Prince and a Saviour to give Repentance to Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and forgiveneſſe of ſins.</hi> So in 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 25. The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Lord muſt in meekneſſe inſtruct thoſe that oppoſe themſelves, if God peradventure will give them Repentance to the acknowledging of the truth.</hi> By theſe Scriptures 'tis clear that Repentance is no flower that growes in Natures Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, though <hi>Arminians</hi> teach and Print, <hi>That if men will but put out their power and their ſtrength, they may repent,</hi> &amp;c. But ſeverall that have been of this Opinion, have experienced the falſeneſſe of it, when it ha's been too late. <hi>The Ethiopian cannot change his skin, nor the Leopard his ſpots,</hi> Jer. 13. 23. And certainly, if there were ſuch a power in man to repent,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:168177:82"/> as ſome would make the world believe, man would never miſcarry everlaſtingly, for his not repenting. Oh! <hi>is it good dwelling with everlaſting burnings? with a devouring fire?</hi> Is it good being for ever ſhut out from the preſence of the

                  </note> Lord, and the glory of his power? Certainly if there were ſuch a power in vaine man to repent, no man would goe to hell for not repenting. And many that have boaſted much of their abilities to repent, when they have been upon a dying bed, would have given a thouſand worlds (were there ſo many in their power) that they could but repent.</p>

                  <hi>with a more diſpleaſing word in all the ſtudy of Divinity, then this word Repent: But after the Lord had converted him, and manifeſted himſelfe to him, he delighted in this worke. Then he could ſorrow for his ſins, and rejoyce in his ſorrow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Repentance ſtrips the ſoule ſtark naked of all the Garments of the old <hi>Adam,</hi> and leaves not ſo much as the ſhirt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. In this rotten building there is not one ſtone left upon another: As the Flood drowned <hi>Noah's</hi> owne friends and ſervants, as well as ſtrangers, ſo true Repentance drownes all darling luſts. True Repentance is the cutting off the right hand, and the pulling out of the right eye, and is this ſuch an eaſie thing? ſurely no. True Repentance is a gift that is from above, and if the Lord does not give it, man will eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally periſh for the want of it. You may read much more of this, in my Treatiſe call'd HEAVEN ON EARTH.</p>

               <p>Againe, this ſpirit is <hi>A comforting ſpirit,</hi> John 14. 16. and <hi>A pleading ſpirit,</hi> Rom. 8. 26. Every Chriſtian ha's three Advocates pleading for him. The firſt is that Divine Love that is in the boſome of the father. The ſecond is the Lord Jeſus, that is at the right hand of the father. And the third is the holy Spirit, that is one with the father.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, He gives his <hi>Blood,</hi> the blood of Chriſt, is a gift of Chriſt to his beloved ones, <hi>Mat. 20. 28. The Son of man came not to be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter, and to give his life a ranſome for many.</hi> So in <hi>John 10. 11.

It was his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blood, his heart-blood, that he gave; it was not the blood of his finger, but the blood of his heart; it was precious blood.

               <p>Fifthly, Chriſt gives <hi>Pardon of ſin,</hi> and doe you know what a mercy that is? Ask the troubled ſoule, ask the ſoule that knowes what it means to lye under the wrath of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and he will tell you that pardon of ſin is a gift more worth then a thouſand worlds.

                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 1, 2. It intitles ſoules to all bleſſedneſſe, it puts the Royall Crowne upon their heads. Of all mercies, pardoning mercy is the moſt ſweetning mercy, 'tis a choyce Jewel, and ſwims to the ſoule in blood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 22. 'Tis a mercy that makes all other mercies to look like mercies, and taſt like mercies, and work like mercies; and the want of it takes off the glory and beauty of all a mans mercies, and makes his life a very hell. Pardon of ſin is a voluminous mercy, a mercy that ha's many precious mercies in the womb of it: You may well call it <hi>Gad,</hi> for it uſhers in Troops of mercy. When you can number the ſands of the ſea, and tell the Stars of heaven, then, and not till then ſhall you be able to recount the mercies that attend pardoning mercy. He that ha's this mercy, cannot be miſerable; he that wants it, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be happy; get this, and get all; miſſe this, and miſſe all; this is a gift confer'd onely upon Chriſts favourites. <hi>Son be</hi>

                  <hi>of good cheere, thy ſins be forgiven thee.</hi> No mercy will make a man everlaſtingly merry, below pardoning mercy. He ha's no reaſon to be ſad, that ha's his pardon in his boſome; nor
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:168177:84"/> he ha's no reaſon to be glad, who is upon the laſt ſtep of the Ladder, ready to be turned off without his Pardon. And this is the fifth gift that Chriſt gives to his, <hi>viz. Pardon of ſinne.</hi>

               <p>There are five Negatives in the Greek, to aſſure Gods people that he will never forſake them. Five times this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Promiſe is renewed in the Scripture, that we might have the ſtronger Conſolation, and that we may preſſe and oppreſſe it, till we have gotten all the ſweetneſſe out of it; and verily many precious ſoules have ſuckt much ſweetneſſe out of the breaſts of this Promiſe, when their neareſt relations, and their deareſt friends have forſaken them, and forgotten them. God loves that his people ſhould put his Bonds, his Promiſes in ſuite; and he that does, ſhall find God near him,

But God is faithfull, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above that you are able,</hi> &amp;c. The Promiſes are a Chriſtians <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> they are his chief Evidences for heaven.

               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Caeſar</hi> gave one a great Reward, <hi>This,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is too great a gift for me to receive;</hi> but ſaith <hi>Caeſar, 'Tis not too great a gift for me to give.</hi> So though the leaſt gift that Chriſt gives (in ſome ſence) is too much for us to receive, yet the greateſt gifts are not too great for Chriſt to give.</p>
               <p>'Tis ſaid of <hi>Araunahs,</hi> that Noble <hi>Jebuſite,</hi> renowned for his bounty, <hi>That he had but a ſubjects purſe, but a Kings heart:</hi> But the Lord Jeſus hath not onely a Kings heart, but he hath alſo a Kings purſe, and gives accordingly.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The world give, but they give <hi>tauntingly,</hi> they give <hi>upbraidingly;</hi> they hit men in the teeth with the gifts they give: I, but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt gives, and he gives <hi>willingly,</hi> he upbraids none with the gifts he gives, <hi>Jam. 1. 5.

               <p>Fourthly, The world gives, but they give <hi>more rarely;</hi> but Chriſt gives, and he gives <hi>frequently;</hi> he is every day, every houre, yea, every moment a giving of Royall favours to his people.

               <p>Sixthly, The world gives <hi>a little, that they may give no more:</hi> I, but Chriſt gives <hi>that he may give.</hi> He gives a little Grace, that he may give <hi>Grace upon Grace.</hi> He gives a little

                  <p>In this I ſhall mind brevity: And</p>
               </argument>
               <p>FIrſt, The Gifts that Chriſt gives to his, are <hi>Spirituall, and Heavenly Gifts:</hi> As is moſt clear by what ha's been already ſaid; and the ſpirituality of them, do's demonſtrate the excellency of them. And doubtleſſe the more ſpirituall any gift, any promiſe, any truth, any prayer, or any ſervice is, the more excellent is that Gift, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All Chriſts Gifts are like himſelfe, ſpirituall and heavenly.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They are <hi>Pure Gifts;</hi> Chriſt gives wine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<note place="margin">Rev. 22. 1. Jam. 3. 17.</note> water; light without darkneſſe; gold without droſſe; and ſweet without bitter. There's much droſſe and poyſon in the Gifts that the world gives, but there's none in the Gifts that Chriſt gives. The ſtreames are as the fountaine is; the fountaine is pure, and ſo are the ſtreames; the branches are

<note place="margin">John 15.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Gifts that Chriſt gives, are <hi>Soule-ſatisfying Gifts:</hi> They are ſuch as are ſutable to the ſoule, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſatisfie the ſoule. Things ſatisfie as they ſuite; there is a Good, and there is a ſutable Good, now 'tis onely the ſutable Good that ſatisfies the ſoule of man. A Pardon is moſt ſutable to a condemned man, and therefore it beſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies him. Health is moſt ſutable to the ſick, and therefore it ſatisfies when 'tis attain'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As bread ſatisfies the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry ſoule, and drink the thirſty ſoule, and cloathing the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſoule: So does the Precious Gifts that Chriſt beſtowes upon the ſoule, ſatisfie the ſoule: The light, the love, the

Pſ. 65. 4, &amp;c.</note> joy, the peace, the fellowſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that Chriſt gives, does abundantly ſatisfie the ſoule. Oh! but Gifts that this world gives, can never ſatisfie the ſoule. <hi>Eccl. 5. 10. He that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth ſilver, ſhall not be ſatisfied with ſilver; nor he that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth</hi>

                  <hi>abundance, with increaſe.</hi> A man may as ſoone fill a Cheſt with Grace, or a quart-pot with virtue, as a heart with wealth. <hi>If Alexander Conquer one World, he will wiſh for another to Conquer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Gifts that Chriſt gives, are <hi>Moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent and laſting Gifts.</hi> The Grace he gives, is call'd <hi>An immortall ſeed;</hi> and the Glory he gives, is call'd <hi>Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Glory.</hi> The Gifts of the world, are fading; a falſe Oath, a ſpark of fire, a ſtorme at ſea, a treacherous friend, brings all to nothing in a moment. Sad experience do's every day confirme this.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, and laſtly, The Gifts that Chriſt gives, are the moſt <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefull Gifts.</hi> They are uſefull to the ſtrengthning of the ſoule againſt Temptations, and to the ſupporting of the

They raiſe the ſtrongeſt joy, the moſt laſting comfort, and the pureſt peace.

                  <hi>Augustus</hi> in his ſolemne Feaſts, gave trifles to ſome, but gold to others. The Lord Jeſus ſcatters the trifles of this world up and downe, as <hi>Luther</hi> well ſpeaks, <hi>The whole Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Empire is but a cruſt that God throwes to a Dogge.</hi> God ſcatters giftleſſe Gifts, <hi>viz.</hi> the honours, riches, and favours of this world, up and downe among the worſt of men; but as for his gold, his ſpirit, his grace, his Son, his favour, theſe are Jewels that he onely caſts into the boſome of Saints, and that <hi>becauſe he dearly loves them.</hi>
               </p>

                  <note place="margin">Wicked men are onely principled to abuſe mercy, which occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons God ſo often to raine hell out of heaven upon them, as he did once up on <hi>Sodome</hi> &amp; <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> for abuſing of mercy. Gen. 25. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>they are beſt principled and fitted to make a Divine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There's no men on earth that are principled and fitted for the improvement of the ſpeciall Gifts that Chriſt gives, but his owne people: None have ſuch principles of wiſdome, love, holineſſe, and faithfullneſſe, to make an improvement of the joy, the peace, the comfort, that the Lord gives, as his people. <hi>Ergo. Abraham gave unto the Sons of the Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines Gifts, and ſent them away, but unto Iſaac he gave all that he had.</hi> As <hi>Iſaac</hi> was better beloved then the Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines Sons, ſo <hi>Iſaac</hi> was better principled to improve love, then they were. The application is eaſie.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He doth it upon this account, <hi>That he may the more indeere the hearts of his people to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The greateſt deſigne of Chriſt in this world, is mightily to indeere the hearts of his people; and indeed it was that which was in his eye, and upon his heart from all eternity. It was this deſigne that cauſed him to lay downe his Crowne, and to take up our Croſſe; to put off his Robes, and to put on our Raggs; to be condemned, that we might be juſtified; to undergo the wrath of the Almighty, that we might for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be in the armes of his mercy. He gives his Spirit, his Grace, yea, and his very ſelfe and all, to indeere the hearts of his people to himſelfe. When <hi>Iſaac</hi> would indeere the heart of <hi>Rebeckah,</hi> then the Bracelets, the Jewels, and the Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings are caſt into her boſome: So the Lord Jeſus caſts his
<note place="margin">Gen. 24. 53.</note>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:168177:89"/> heavenly Bracelets, Jewels, and Ear-rings, into the boſomes, into the laps of his people, out of a deſigne to indeere him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe unto them. <hi>Prov. 17. 8. A Gift is a precious ſtone in the eyes of him that hath it, whither ſoever it turneth, it proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</hi> In the Hebrew 'tis thus, <hi>A Gift is as a ſtone of grace:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>
                  </note> That is, it makes a man very acceptable and gracious, in the eyes of others. A Gift is like that precious ſtone <hi>Pantarbe,</hi> that hath a marvellous conſiliating property in it: Or like the wonder-working <hi>Load-ſtone,</hi> that as ſome Writers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, hath among other Properties this, That it makes thoſe that have it, well-ſpoken men, and well accepted of Princes. Certainly the Gifts that Jeſus Chriſt gives to his, doe render him very acceptable and precious in their eyes. Chriſt to them is the Crowne of Crownes; the Heaven of Heaven; the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Glories; he is the moſt ſparkling Diamond in the Ring of Glory, <hi>Prov. 18. 16. A mans Gift maketh roome for him, and bringeth him before great men.</hi> The Gifts that Jeſus Chriſt gives, widen the heart, and inlarge the ſoule of a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, to take in more of himſelfe. Naturally we are nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row-mouthed Heaven-ward, and wide-mouthed earth-ward: But the Lord Jeſus by caſting in his Jewels, his Pearles, his precious Gifts into the ſoule, doth widen the ſoule, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the ſoule, and make it more capacious to entertaine
<note place="margin">Pſal. 24. 7, 8, 9, 10.</note> himſelfe. Chriſt by his Gifts cauſes all doores to ſtand open, <hi>that the King of glory may enter in.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the fourth Reaſon of the Point, is, <hi>Becauſe Chriſt expects more from his people, then he doth from all the world beſides; therefore he gives them the beſt Gifts.</hi>

               <p>Fifthly, The Lord Jeſus gives the beſt gifts to his owne people, <hi>That he may fence and ſtrengthen them againſt the worſt Temptations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are no men on earth that lye open to temptations, as Saints; the beſt men have been alwayes the moſt tempted. The more excellent any man is in grace and holineſſe, the more ſhall that man be followed with temptations; as you may ſee in <hi>David,</hi> who was tempted by Satan to number the people; and <hi>Joh,</hi> to curſe God, and dye; and <hi>Peter,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſt; and ſo <hi>Paul</hi> was buffeted; yea, and Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe moſt grievouſly aſſaulted. The Lord knowes well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that Satan hath a cruell eye, an envious eye, a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious eye upon his beloved ones, and therefore he is pleaſed by his precious Gifts, to ſtrengthen them againſt his aſſaults.

               <p>I have read a remarkeable ſtory of a great Rebell, that had

Whereupon the Emperour reaſons thus, If I ſhould now cut him off, the world would ſay, I did it to ſave my money; and ſo he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned him, and gave him the great ſum of money, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all his former Rebellion.</p>
               <p>Oh! ſhall a Heathen Emperour doe thus to a Rebell that was in Armes againſt him? And will not God doe as much for poore rebellious ſinners? Surely he will. What though thou haſt been in Armes againſt God? and Muſtered

               <p>The Greek word <hi>Caris,</hi> that's here rendred <hi>Grace,</hi> we ſhewed you had a three-fold ſignification in the Scripture. Sometimes it denotes the favour of God; ſometimes the common gifts of the Spirit; and ſometimes the ſaving Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Spirit. Now, ſayes <hi>Paul,</hi> that ſingular favour that God ha's confer'd upon me, and all thoſe common gifts, and ſpeciall graces with which he ha's inriched me, they are all to be imployed and exerciſed. <hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To me is this grace given.</hi> Not that I ſhould be idle, but active; not that I ſhould be negligent, but diligent; not that I ſhould hide my Talents, but improve them.</p>
               <p>I ſhall touch upon a few Scriptures that ſpeak out this truth, and then open it to you. 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 6. Wherefore I put thee in remembrance, that thou ſtir up the gift of God that is in thee.</hi> As the fire is increaſed and preſerved by blowing, ſo are our graces. Some think that 'tis a metaphor taken from

Oh ſaith ſuch a poore ſoule, I pray, Sir, and yet I ſin; I reſolve againſt ſin, and yet I ſin; I combate againſt ſin, and yet I am carried Captive by ſin; I have left no outward means unattempted, and yet after all, my ſins are too hard for me; after all my ſweating, ſtriving and weeping, I am carried downe the ſtreame: There's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now but the actings of faith upon a crucified Chriſt, that will take off this burden from the ſoule of man: Now you muſt make uſe of your graces, to draw virtue from Chriſt; now faith muſt touch the hem of Chriſts garment, or thou wilt never be healed. 'Tis juſt with a ſoule in this caſe, as it was with the ponre widow, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 43. to 49. that had a bloody iſſue, ſhe leaves no means unattempted, whereby ſhe might be cured; ſhe runs from one Phyſitian to another, till ſhe had ſpent all that ſhe was worth, till ſhe had brought a noble to nine-pence; and now ſayes ſhe, <hi>If I could but touch the hem of his Garment, I ſhould be whole.</hi> Hereupon ſhe crowds through the crowd to come to Chriſt, and being got behind him, ſhe touches the hem of his garment, <hi>and immediately ſhe was made whole.</hi> The cure being thus wrought, Chriſt uncrownes himſelfe, to crowne her faith. <hi>And he ſaid unto her, daughter be of good comfort, thy faith hath made thee whole, goe in peace.</hi> He doth not ſay, woman thy trembling hath made thee whole; or woman thy ſweating and ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling in a crowd to come to me, hath made thee whole; or woman thy falling downe and abaſing thy ſelfe, (though ſhe did all this) but, <hi>woman thy faith hath made thee whole.</hi> Ah Chriſtians, 'tis not your trembling, or your falling downe, or your ſweating in this and that ſervice, that will ſtop the bloody iſſue of your ſins, but believing in Chriſt. 'Tis ſad to conſider how few Profeſſors in theſe dayes, have attain'd the right way of mortifying of ſin; they uſually goe out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

Nothing eats out ſin, like the actings of grace; nothing weakers and waſts the ſtrength of ſin, like the exerciſe of grace. Oh did men believe more in Chriſt, ſin would dye more; did they believe the threatnings more, ſin would dye more; did they believe the Promiſes more, ſin would dye more; did they believe reigning with Chriſt more, ſin would dye more. <hi>He that hath</hi>

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:168177:104"/> of this truth, many profeſſors take ſuch libertie to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as to live in the neglect of many precious duties of Godlineſſe, for which firſt or laſt they will pay deare. But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring that 'tis not a flood of words, but weighty argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that convinces and perſwades the ſoules and conſciences of men. I ſhall give you foure reaſons to demonſtrate, That Beleevers have a power to doe good; and the firſt is this.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe they have life,</hi> and all life is a power to act
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Omnis vita eſt propter delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem.</hi>
                  </note> by; naturall life is a power to act by, ſpirituall life is a power to act by, eternall life is a power to act by. The Philoſopher ſayth, <hi>That a fly is more excellent then the heavens, becauſe the fly hath life, which the heavens have not,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Elſe there is no juſt Ground for Chriſt to charge</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Omiſſion of diet breeds diſeaſes, ſo doth omiſſion of dutie, and makes worke either for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, hel, or the phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian of ſouls.</note> 
                  <hi>the guilt of ſins upon them;</hi> as neglect of Prayer, Repentance, Mortification, nor the guilt of Careleſneſſe, and Sloathfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, &amp;c. which he doth, if they can act no further, nor no longer then the Holy-Ghoſt acts them, as at their firſt conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, notwithſtanding their union with Chriſt, and that ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall principle of life that at firſt they received from Chriſt; Certainly if it be ſo, it will not ſtand with the unſpotted Juſtice of God to charge the guilt of ſins of omiſſion upon Beleeving ſoules, if they have no power to act, but are as ſtocks and ſtones, &amp;c. as ſome dreame.</p>
               <p>A third Ground is this; <hi>If there be not ſome power in Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to doe good, then we ſhould not have as much benefit by the</hi>

'Tis the very nature of grace to be diffuſive and communicative; grace can't be long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd. The better any thing is, the more communicative it will be. Grace is as fire in the bones, as new Wine in the bottles, you cannot hide it, you muſt give vent to it. <hi>Acts 4. 20.

No way to honour God, no way to win ſoules, nor no way to increaſe your owne gifts and graces, then to exerciſe them for the good of others. Grace is not like to worldly vanities, that diminiſh by diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution; nor like Candles, which keep the ſame light, though a thouſand are lighted by them. Grace is like the widows Oyle, which multiplied by powring out; and like thoſe

Art thou, O Chriſtian, bound to doe good to others, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating earthly things? And art thou not much more bound to doe them good by communicating of ſpirituall things? Surely thou art. Why are Chriſtians ſo often in Scripture compar'd to Trees, but becauſe of their fruitfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and uſefullneſſe to others? And why are they called <hi>Stewards of the manifold gifts of God,</hi> but to note to us, that their gifts are not to be incloſed, but imployed for the good of others? And why ha's Chriſt put a box of precious Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into every Chriſtians hand, but that it ſhould be opened for the benefit of others? Certainly he that is good, is bound to doe good, for gifts and graces are given, not onely to make us good, and keep us good, but alſo to make us, yea, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:168177:108"/> us to doe good. <hi>Lilmod lelammed, We therefore learn, that we may teach,</hi> is a Proverb among the Rabbins. <hi>And I doe therefore lay in, and lay up</hi> (ſaith the Heathen) <hi>that I may draw forth againe, and lay out for the good of many.</hi> I think they are no good Chriſtians that ſhall ſcorne to learne this good leſſon, though of a Heathen. And O that all that write themſelves Chriſtians, were ſo good as to imitate the good that ſhin'd in many Heathens! To me 'tis ſad, that Chriſtians that live and act below the very Heathens, ſhould be offended to hear now and then of thoſe excellencies that ſparkled in the very Heathens. I think that is a very evill ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that can't indure to heare of thoſe excellencies in others, that he wants in himſelfe. Certainly he is a brave Chriſtian, and ha's much of Chriſt within, that accounts nothing his own, that he does not communicate to others. The <hi>Bee</hi> doth ſtore her Hive out of all ſorts of flowers, for the common benefit, and why then in this ſhould not every Chriſtian be like a <hi>Bee?</hi>

               <p>The third and laſt thing to which you are to improve your gifts and graces, is, <hi>To the benefit and profit of your own ſoules.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The good of the ſoule is ſpecially to be minded 1 Becauſe 'tis the moſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of man. 2 Becauſe the Image of God is moſt fairly ſtampt upon it. 3 Becauſe it is firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. 4 Becauſe it ſhall be firſt glorified.</note> Not to improve them to your owne internall and eternall good, is with a high hand to croſſe the maine end of Gods conferring them upon you.

               <p>I ſhall content my ſelfe with giving you this hint, becauſe I have before ſpoken more fully to this head.</p>

               <p>Then in the firſt place, this looks very ſowrely and wiſhly upon all lazie, idle, negligent Chriſtians, that doe not ſtir up

'Tis ſad to ſee how buſie many men are, to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and improve a Talent of riches, who yet bind up their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents of gifts and grace in a Napkin: By theſe God looſes much honour and praiſe, and themſelves looſe much comfort and content, and others looſe much profit and benefit, and the Goſpel looſes much credit and glory.</p>
               <p>But the maine Uſe that I ſhall make of this Point, ſhall be <hi>To exhort and ſtir you all up, to make a bleſſed improvement of your graces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed it is a Point of moſt ſingular uſe to us all our
<note place="margin">The Jewiſh Rabbins re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, That he ſame night that <hi>Iſrael</hi> de parted out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Canaan.</hi> all the Idols &amp; Idolatrou.

               <p>Now there are ſeven Conſiderations that I ſhall propound by way of Motive, to ſtir up your ſoules to make a bleſſed improvement of the grace and gifts you have received.</p>
               <p>And the firſt is this, <hi>Seriouſly conſider, that the exerciſe and improvement of grace in your ſoules, will be more and more the death and ruine of ſin in your ſoules.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take it from experience, There is not a choycer way then this, for a man to bring under the power of his ſin, then to keep up the exerciſe of his grace. Sin and Grace are like two Buckets at a Well, when one is up, the other is downe: They are like the two Lawrels at <hi>Rome,</hi> when one flouriſhes, the other withers. Certainly the readieſt, and the ſureſt way to bring under the power of ſin, is, to be much in the exerciſe of grace, <hi>Rom. 8. 10. And if Chriſt be in you, the body is dead, becauſe of ſin, but the ſpirit is life, becauſe of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</hi> The life and activity of Chriſt and grace in the ſoule, is the death and deſtruction of ſin in the ſoule: The more
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:168177:109"/> grace acts in the ſoule, the more ſin withers and dyes in the ſoule; the ſtronger the houſe of <hi>David</hi> grew, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. the weaker the houſe of <hi>Saul</hi> grew. As the houſe of <hi>David</hi> grew every day ſtronger and ſtronger, ſo the houſe of <hi>Saul</hi> every day grew weaker and weaker: So the activity of the new
<note place="margin">Mat. 21. 12, 13, 14.</note> man, is the death of the old man. When Chriſt began to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtir himſelfe in the Temple, the money-changers quickly fled out: So when grace is active and ſtirring in the ſoule, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption quickly flyes. A man may find out many wayes to hide his ſin, but he will never find out any way to ſubdue his ſin, but by the exerciſe of grace. Of all Chriſtians, none ſo mortified as thoſe in whom grace is moſt exerciſed. Sin is a Viper that muſt be kill'd, or 'twill kill you for ever; and there is no way to kill it, but by the exerciſe of grace.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider this by way of motive to provoke you

Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good workes, and glorifie your Father which is in heaven.</hi> The light of your Converſation, and the light of your graces; Oh! how many thouſand ſoules be there now triumphing in heaven, whoſe gifts and graces ſhin'd gloriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when they were on earth: and ah! how many thouſands are there now on earth, that bleſſe and admire the Lord for the ſhine of their graces, who are now in heaven; That bleſſe the Lord for the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Zeale of <hi>David,</hi> and the Meekneſſe of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Patience of <hi>Job,</hi> and the Courage of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> &amp;c. Ah Chriſtians! as you would ſtirre up others to exalt the God of grace, look to the exerciſe and improvement of your graces. When poor ſervants ſhall live in a family, and ſee the faith of a Maſter, and the love of a Maſter, and the wiſedome of a Maſter, and the patience of a Maſter, and the humility of a Maſter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhining like ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtars of heaven, oh how doth it draw forth their hearts to bleſſe the Lord, that ever they came into ſuch a family? 'Tis not a profeſſion of Religion, but the exerciſe and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of grace, that contributes ſo much to the lifting up of the glory of the Lord, and to the greatning of his praiſe in the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:168177:110"/> world. Many Saints have had their hearts warmed and heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſiting by other Saints fire, by eying and dwelling upon other Saints graces. Ah! when mens graces ſhine as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> his face did; when their lives, as one ſpeaketh of <hi>Joſeph's</hi> life, is a very heaven, ſparkling with variety of virtues, as with ſo many bright Stars; ah! how are others ſtirr'd up to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God? and to cry out theſe are Chriſtians indeed? theſe are an honour to their God, a Crowne to their Chriſt, and a credit to their Goſpel: Oh! if they were all ſuch, we would be Chriſtians too. 'Tis a very great ſtumbling-block to many poor ſinners, to ſee men that make a very great and large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<note place="margin">Thoſe in whom virtue is extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed, are like unto painted, and printed papers, which ignorant men honour and worſhip in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Chriſt. <hi>Rawleigh.</hi>

               <p>'Twas one of <hi>Matchavils</hi> Principles, <hi>That the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of virtue was onely to be ſought, becauſe the uſe of it</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is a trouble, but the credit of it a helpe.</hi> I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid that this curſed, ſoule-damning Principle, is the beſt flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that growes in many mens Gardens in theſe dayes. Though there is no virtue, but is as a bright ſtone in a dark night, it ſhines and ſhewes its clearneſſe and beauty, 'tis as pure gold, the brighter for paſſing through the fire, yet how doe moſt

Such, I believe, ſhall have the hotteſt, and the loweſt place in hell.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>but to the Saints, and to the excellent, in whom is all my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</hi> And doubtleſſe, they that are his greateſt delight on earth, ſhall be poſſeſt of the greateſt glory in Heaven. If fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers give the greateſt portions to thoſe Children in whom they delight, why ſhould not Chriſt? Is it equity in the one, and iniquity in the other? Surely no: Chriſt may doe with his owne as he pleaſes.</p>
               <p>Againe, The more any man improves his Grace, the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:168177:113"/> clearer, ſweeter, fuller, and richer is his injoyments of God here: There's no man in all the world that hath ſuch injoyments of God, as that man hath, that moſt improves his Graces. 'Tis not he that knows moſt, nor him that hears moſt, nor yet he that talkes moſt, but he that exerciſes Grace moſt, that hath moſt communion with God, that hath the cleareſt viſions of God, that hath the ſweeteſt diſcoveries, and manifeſtations of God. Now certainly if they that improve their graces moſt, have moſt of God here, then without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, they ſhall have moſt of God hereafter. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe a man may as well plead for equall degrees of Grace in this world, as for equall degrees of glory in the other world.</p>
               <p>Againe, If thoſe who are moſt graceleſſe and wicked, ſhall be moſt tormented, then certainly they that are moſt graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſhall be moſt exalted in the day of Chriſt: But the more wicked any man is, the more ſhall he be tormented in the
<note place="margin">Mat. 23. 14. Luke 12. 47, 48.</note> day of vengeance. <hi>Woe to you Scribes and Phariſees, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, for ye ſhall receive the greater damnation.</hi> The darkeſt, the loweſt, the hotteſt place in hell, is provided for you; therefore it roundly followes, <hi>That thoſe that are moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, ſhall at laſt be moſt glorious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus much for the Motives that tend to provoke all the precious Children of <hi>Zion,</hi> to make a through im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the Gifts and Graces that the Lord ha's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd upon them.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now come to the reſolution of a weighty Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo conclude this Point, (which I have been the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger upon, by reaſon of its very great uſefullneſſe in theſe dayes, wherein men ſtrive to exerciſe any thing, yea, every thing but grace and holineſſe, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Queſtion is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When may a ſoule be ſaid to be excellent in Grace, or</hi>

               <p>Firſt, A ſoule that's high and excellent in grace, that hath improved his Graces to a conſiderable height, <hi>will keepe humble and unſpotted under great outward injoyments.</hi> 'Tis ſaid of <hi>Daniel,</hi> that <hi>he had an excellent ſpirit;</hi> and herein

Dan. 6. 3-7. Daniel</hi> keeps humble and holy, when he is lifted high, yea, made the ſecond man in the Kingdome: Malice it ſelfe could not find any thing againſt him, but in the matter of his God. 'Tis much, to be very gracious when a man is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great; and to be high in holineſſe, when advanc'd to high places; uſually mens blood riſes with their outward good: Certainly they are worthy ones, and ſhall walk with Chriſt
<note place="margin">Rev. 3. 4.</note> in white, whoſe Garments are not defiled with greatneſſe, or riches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, They that have highly improved their graces, <hi>will comply with thoſe commands of God that croſſe nature, that are contrary to nature:</hi> And doubtleſſe that man ha's improv'd his graces to a very high rate, whoſe heart com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies with thoſe Commands of God, that are croſſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to nature: As for a man to love them that loath him,

'Tis nothing to love them that love us, and to ſpeak well of them that ſpeak well of us; and to doe well, and carry it well towards them, that carry it well towards us: Oh! but for a man to love thoſe that hate him; to be cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous to them that are curriſh to him; to be ſweet to them that are bitter to him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this ſtrongly demonſtrates a high improvement of grace. Certainly that man is very very good, who ha's learned that holy Leſſon of <hi>overcoming evill with good.</hi> Such a one was <hi>Stephen,</hi> Acts 7. 55—<hi>ult.</hi>

                  <hi>He was a man full of the holy Ghoſt:</hi> That is, of the Gifts and graces of the Holy Ghoſt; he was much in the exerciſe of Grace, he can pray, and ſigh for them, yea, even weepe teares of blood for them, who rejoyced to ſhed his blood: So did Chriſt weep over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſo did <hi>Titus,</hi> ſo did <hi>Marcellus</hi> over <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> ſo did <hi>Scipio</hi> over <hi>Carthage,</hi> but they ſhed teares for them, whoſe blood they were to ſhed;
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:168177:114"/> but Chriſt ſhed teares for them, who were to ſhed his blood. So <hi>Abraham being ſtrong in faith gave glory to God.</hi> How?
<note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note> why, by complying with thoſe commands of God, that were very contrary to fleſh and blood; as the offering up of his Son, his onely Son, his beloved Son, his Son of the Promiſe, and by leaving his owne Countrey, and his near and dear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, upon a word of Command. The Commands of God ſo change the whole man, and make him new, that you can hardly know him to be the ſame man, ſaith one. Well Sirs,

               <p>Thirdly, conſider this, Such ſoules <hi>will follow the Lord fully, that have made an improvement of their graces.</hi> Oh! this was the glorious commendations of <hi>Caleb;</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> in <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 24. that <hi>They followed the Lord fully,</hi> in the face of all difficulties and diſcouragements: <hi>They had another ſpirit in them,</hi> ſayes the Text, they would goe up and poſſeſſe the Land, though the Walls were as high as Heaven, and

               <p>
                  <hi>They followed the Lord fully:</hi> In the Hebrew it is, <hi>They fullfilled after me.</hi> The Hebrew word is a metaphor taken from a Ship under ſaile, that's carried with a ſtrong wind, as fearing neither Sands, nor Rocks, nor Shelves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such have little, if any thing of Chriſt within, who follow him by halves, or haltingly.</p>
               <p>I remember <hi>Cyprian</hi> brings in the Devil triumphing over Chriſt thus, <hi>As for my followers, I never dyed for them, as Chriſt did for his, I never promiſed them ſo great reward, as Chriſt hath done to his, and yet I have more followers then he, and they doe more for me, then his doe for him.</hi> O where is that ſpirit in theſe dayes, that was upon thoſe Worthies? <hi>Pſal. 44. All this is come upon us, yet have we not forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thee, neither have we dealt falſely in thy Covenant; our</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Such ſoules that have improved their Graces to a conſiderable height, <hi>will bleſſe God as well when he frowns, as when he ſmiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As well when he takes, as when he gives; when he ſtrikes, as when he ſtrokes, as you may ſee by comparing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the Margent together. When the Lord had ſtript <hi>Job</hi> of all, and had ſet him naked upon the dunghill, why then

               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, Soules that have improved their Graces to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable height, <hi>will be good in bad times, and in bad places.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such ſoules will bear up againſt the ſtream of evill exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, in the worſt of times, and in the worſt of places. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>

               <p>Some ſay that <hi>Roſes</hi> grow the ſweeter, when they are plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Garlick:</hi> Verily Chriſtians that have gloriouſly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved their Graces, are like thoſe <hi>Roſes,</hi> they grow ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſweeter, holier and holier, by wicked men.

               <p>Sixthly, <hi>Such turne their principles into practice.</hi> They turne their ſpeculations into power, their notions into ſpirit, their glorious inſide into a golden outſide, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 13.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Eighthly, <hi>Such are alwayes moſt buſied about the higheſt things,</hi> viz. God, Chriſt, Heaven, <hi>&amp;c. Phil. 3. 2 Tim. 4. 8. 2 Cor. 4. ult. Rom.</hi> 8. 18.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, <hi>Such are alwayes a doing or receiving good:</hi> As Chriſt went up and downe doing good, <hi>Mat. 4. 23. Chap. 9. 35. Mark</hi> 6. 6.</p>

            <p>We ſhall begin with the firſt Point at this time, namely,</p>
            <q>That the Lord Jeſus Christ is very rich.</q>
            <p>For the opening of this Point, we ſhall attempt theſe three things.</p>

            </list>
            <p>And then the Uſe of the Point.</p>
            <pb n="207" facs="tcp:168177:116"/>
            <p>For the firſt, <hi>That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is very rich.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Expreſſe Scripture ſpeaks out this truth. He is <hi>rich in goodneſſe,</hi> Rom. 2. 4. <hi>Or deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his goodneſſe,</hi> that is ready to be imployed for thy internall and
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>To chreſton.</hi> His native good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> eternall good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, He is <hi>rich in wiſedome and knowledge,</hi> Col, 2. 3. <hi>In whom</hi> (ſpeaking of Chriſt) <hi>are hid all the treaſures of wiſedome and knowledge.</hi> Chriſt was content that his riches ſhould be hid from the world; therefore doe not thou be
<note place="margin">As man is an Epitome of the whole world, ſo is Chriſt of all wiſedome and knowledge, &amp;c.</note> angry that thine is no more knowne to the world: What is thy one mite, to Chriſts many millions? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, He is <hi>rich in grace,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 7. <hi>By whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveneſſe of ſins, according to the riches of his grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, He is <hi>rich in glory,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 18. <hi>That ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what is the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints.</hi> So in <hi>Chap. 3. 16. That he would grant unto you according to the riches of his glory, to be ſtrengthned with might by his ſpirit in the</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Nec Chriſtus nec coelum pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur hyperbolem.</hi> Neither Chriſt nor heaven can be hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolized.</note> 
               <hi>inner man.</hi> So in <hi>Phil. 4. 19. But my God ſhall ſupply all your need, according to his riches in glory by Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> The riches of glory are unconceiveable riches: Search is made through all the bowells of the earth, for ſomething to ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow it by: The riches of this glory is fitter to be believed, then to be diſcourſed of, as ſome of the very Heathens have acknowledged.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, As expreſſe Scripture ſpeaks out this truth, <hi>That Christ is very rich,</hi> ſo there are eight things more that doe with open mouth ſpeak out Chriſt to be very rich.</p>
            <p>Firſt, You may judge of his riches, by <hi>the dowry and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion his father hath given him.</hi> In <hi>Pſal. 2. 7. Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee; aske of me, and I will give thee the Heathen for thine inheritance, and the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion.</hi> He is <hi>the heir of all things,</hi> all things above and below, in heaven and earth, are his. <hi>Heb. 1. 2. God hath in theſe laſt dayes ſpoken to us by his Son, whom he hath appointed Heire of all things.</hi> Chriſt is the richeſt Heire in heaven and earth: Men cry up this man
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:168177:117"/> to be a good match, and that, and why ſo? but becauſe they are great Heires. Ah! but what are all the great Heires of the world, to this Heire, the Lord Jeſus? <hi>Joſeph</hi> gave Portions to all his brethren, but to <hi>Benjamin</hi> a Portion five times as good as what he gave the reſidue: So the Lord ſcatters Portions among the Sons of men, he gives braſſe to ſome, gold to others; temporalls to ſome, ſpiritualls to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but the greateſt portion of all, he hath given into the hands of Chriſt, whom he hath made the Heire of all things. <hi>Rev. 11. 15. And the ſeventh Angel ſounded, and there were great voyces in heaven, ſaying, The Kingdomes of this world are become the Kingdomes of our Lord, and of his Chriſt, and he ſhall reigne for ever and ever.</hi> So in <hi>Chap. 19. 11, 12. And I ſaw heaven opened, and behold a white Horſe, and he that ſat upon him was called, faithfull and true, and in righteouſneſſe he doth judge, and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many Crownes.</hi> (Mark that) what are Princes ſingle Crownes, and the Popes tripple Crowne to Chriſts many Crownes? Certainly he muſt be very rich, that ha's ſo many Kingdomes and Crownes; waite but a while, and you ſhall ſee theſe Scriptures made good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, You may judge of his riches, by his <hi>Keeping open houſe for the reliefe and ſupply of all created creatures, both in heaven and in earth.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>You look upon thoſe as very rich, that keep open houſe for all commers and goers; why, ſuch a one is the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, he keeps open houſe for all commers and goers, for all created creatures both in heaven and earth. <hi>Pſal. 104. 24. The earth is full of thy riches, ſo is the great and wide ſea, where are things creeping innumerable, both ſmall and great. He opens his hand, and he ſatisfies every living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> ſayes the Pſalmiſt. So <hi>Iſa. 55. 1. Ho every one that thirſteth let him come and buy wine and milke without money, and without price; wherefore doeſt thou lay out thy money for that which is not bread, and thy ſtrength for that which doth not profit?</hi> All Creatures, high and low, honourable and baſe, noble and ignoble, bleſſed and curſed, are fed, at the coſt and charge of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: They are all fed at his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:168177:117"/> and maintained by what comes out of his treaſury, his purſe. All Angels and Saints above, and all Saints and ſinners below, are beholding to Chriſt for what they injoy. Oh the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, the numberleſſe number of thoſe that live upon the coſt and charge of Chriſt! Can you number the Stars of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? Can you number the ſands upon the ſea-ſhore? Then may you number the multitudes, the millions of Angels and men that are maintained upon the coſt and charge of the Lord Jeſus. In <hi>Col. 1. 16, 17. For by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth, viſible and inviſible, whether they be Thrones, or Dominions, or Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, or Powers, all things were created by him, and for him. And he is before all things, and by him all things conſiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, You may judge of the riches of Chriſt by <hi>The time that he hath fed and cloathed, cheriſhed and maintained ſo many innumerable millions of Angels and men,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He hath maintained his Court above and below, upon his owne coſt and charge, for almoſt ſix thouſand years. Oh to keep ſuch a multitude, if it were but for a day, would ſpeak him out to be richer then all the Princes in the World: But to keep ſo many millions, and to keep them ſo long, what do's this ſpeak out, but that Chriſt is infinitely rich, rich in goodneſſe and mercy. It would begger all the Princes on earth, to keep but one day the leaſt part of thoſe that Chriſt maintaines every day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Fourthly, You may judge of the riches of Chriſt by this, <hi>That he doth not onely inrich all the Saints, but all of the Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is, He inriches all the faculties of their ſoules, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riches their underſtandings with glorious light, their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences with quickneſſe, pureneſſe, tenderneſſe, and quietneſſe; and their wills with holy intentions, and heavenly reſolutions, and their affections of love, joy, feare, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with life, heat, and warmth, and with the beauty and glory of the moſt ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inriching, ſoule-delighting, ſoule-raviſhing, and ſoule-content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing objects, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All Saints experiences ſeale to this truth, and therefore a touch ſhall ſuffice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, Judge of the riches of Chriſt, by this, <hi>That not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding</hi>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:168177:118"/> 
               <hi>all the vaſt expence and charge that he is at, and hath been at for ſo many millions of thouſands, and that for neare ſix thouſand yeares, yet he is never the poorer, his purſe is never the emptier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is ſtill in Chriſt a fullneſſe of Abundance, and a full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Redundance, notwithſtanding all that he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended. It were blaſphemy to think that Chriſt ſhould be a penny the poorer by all that he hath laid out for the relief of all thoſe that have their dependance upon him. <hi>Col. 1. 19. It pleaſed the father that in him ſhould all fullneſſe dwell:</hi> Not ſtay or abide a night, or a day, and away, but ſhould
<note place="margin">They ſay 'tis true of the Oyle at <hi>Rhemes,</hi> That though it be continually ſpent in the inauguration of their Kings of <hi>France,</hi> yet it never waſt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth. I am ſure though all Creatures ſpend conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually on Chriſts ſtock, yet it never waſteth.</note> 
               <hi>dwell:</hi> The Sun hath not the leſſe light, for filling the ſtars with light. A Fountaine hath not the leſſe for filling the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer veſſels. There is in Chriſt <hi>(Plenit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>do fontis) The full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a fountaine:</hi> The overflowing Fountaine powres out water abundantly, and yet remaines full; why, the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is ſuch an overflowing Fountaine, he fills all, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines full. Chriſt ha's the greateſt worth and wealth in him, as the worth and value of many pieces of ſilver is in one piece of gold, ſo all his petty excellencies ſcattered abroad in the Creature, are united to Chriſt; yea, all the whole volume of perfections, which is ſpread through Heaven and Earth, is Epitomized in him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, The Lord Jeſus is <hi>Generally rich;</hi> and that ſpeaks him out to be rich indeed, <hi>he is generally rich.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have few perſons that are generally rich, that is, a rich man indeed, that is generally rich, that is, that is rich in money, and rich in Land, and rich in Commodities, and rich in Jewels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is one that is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally rich; he is rich in all ſpiritualls, he is <hi>rich in goodneſſe, rich in wiſedome and knowledge, he is rich in grace, and rich in glory:</hi> Yea, he is generally rich in reſpect of temporalls, <hi>He is the Heire of all things;</hi> he is the Heire of all the Gold in
<note place="margin">The Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher once ſaid <hi>(Solus ſapiens dives)</hi> Onely the wiſe man is the rich man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> the world, and of all the Silver, and of all the Jewels, and of all the Land, and of all the Cattell in the world, as you may ſee by comparing ſome Scriptures together, <hi>Hoſ. 2. 5, 8, 9. For their Mother hath played the Harlot, ſhe that conceived them hath done ſhamefully, for ſhe ſaid, I will goe after my Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:168177:118"/> 
               <hi>that gave me my bread and my water, and my wool, and my flax, my Oyle, and my drinke.</hi> But mark what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, <hi>verſ. 8, 9. For ſhe did not know that I gave her corne, and wine, and Oyle, and multiplied her ſilver and gold, which they prepared for Baal; therefore will I returne, and take away my Corne in the time thereof, and my wine in the ſeaſon thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax, given to cover her nakedneſſe.</hi> So in <hi>Pſal. 24. 1. The earth is the Lords, and the fullneſſe thereof, the round world, and all that dwell there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in:</hi> All others are either Uſurpers, or Stewards. 'Tis the Lord Jeſus that is the great Landlord of Heaven and Earth. So in <hi>Pſal. 50. 8, 9, 10. I will not reprove thee for thy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, or thy burnt-offrings, I will take no Bullock out of thy houſe, nor He-goats out of thy folds, for every Beaſt of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt is mine, and the Cattell upon a thouſand hills. I know all the Fowles of the mountaines, and the wild Beaſts of the fields are mine. If I were hungry, I would not tell thee, for the world is mine, and the fullneſſe thereof.</hi> 'Tis all mine, ſaith the Lord.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee that the Lord is generally rich, rich in houſes, in Lands, in Gold, in Silver, in Cattell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in all temporalls as well as in ſpiritualls; but where will you find a man that is generally rich, either in ſpiritualls, or temporalls. 'Tis true, you may find one Chriſtian rich in one grace, and another Chriſtian rich in another, but where will you find a Chriſtian that is generally rich, that is rich in every grace? that is rich in knowledge, in faith, in love, in wiſedome, in humility, in meekneſſe, in patience, in ſelfe-denyall. <hi>Abraham</hi> was rich in <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> was rich in <hi>Meekneſſe,</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> was rich in <hi>Patience,</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> was rich in <hi>Courage,</hi> and <hi>David</hi>

Or where will you find a man that is generally rich, in reſpect of temporalls, as to be rich in lands, and rich in moneys, and rich in wares, and rich in Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But now the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is generally rich, both in reſpect of ſpiritualls, and temporalls. <hi>In having nothing I have all things</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>becauſe I have Chriſt, having therefore all things in him, I ſeeke no other reward, for he is the univerſall reward,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <pb n="212" facs="tcp:168177:119"/>
            <p>Seventhly, You may judge of the riches of Chriſt, by the <hi>Tribute and Rent that's due to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is the great Landlord and owner of all that Angels and

               <p>Poverty hinders many a match. The Lord did foreſee from eternity, That fallen man would never look after Chriſt, if there were not ſomething to be gotten by Chriſt; the Lord hath therefore in his wiſedome and goodneſſe to fallen man, thus preſEnted him, as one exceeding rich, that ſo poore ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners might fall in love with him, and be willing to give up themſelves to him. <hi>Prov. 8. 34, 35.

               <p>A ſecond Ground of this, is,</p>
               <q>Becauſe he is Ordained by the father to convey all riches of Grace to his choſen and beloved ones.</q>
               <p>John 1. 16. <hi>Of his fullneſſe we all receive grace for grace.</hi> And this we receive by Divine ordination. <hi>John 6. 27.

Oh how will their countenances be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, their thoughts troubled, their joynts looſed, their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences enraged, and their ſoules terrified, when they ſhall ſee what a rich Match they have refuſed, and thereupon how juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are for ever accurſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, It is upon this account,</p>
               <q>That he may be a compleat Redeemer to us, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may hinder our ſoules cloſing with the Lord Jeſus Christ.</q>
               <p>We ſtand in need of one that's rich, rich in grace to pardon us, rich in power to ſupport us, and rich in goodneſſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve us, and rich in glory to Crowne us, there's none but ſuch
<note place="margin">We may ſay of Chriſt, as Writers ſay of the <hi>Jaſper,</hi> it's eaſier to admire then declare it, and far more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſay what he is not, then what he is.</note> a Chriſt can ſerve our turnes. We ſtand in need of one that's rich, that's generally rich, one that's rich in money to pay all our debts. We have run much upon the ſcore with God, and none can pay this ſcore, but Chriſt; our ſins are debts that none can pay but Chriſt: 'Tis not our teares, but his blood, 'tis not our ſighes, but his ſufferings, that can ſatisfie for our ſins. We are much in debt to God, for the ground we tread on, the aire we breath in, the beds we lye on, the bread we eat, the cloaths we wear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and none can pay this debt but Chriſt. Angels and Saints may pitty us, but they cannot diſcharge the leaſt debt for us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Chriſt muſt pay all, or we are Priſoners for ever, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We ſtand in need of one that's rich in goodneſſe, we are a needy people, and are ſtill in want; Chriſt muſt be ſtill a giving, or we ſhall be ſtill a languiſhing, if he ſhut his hand we periſh and returne to duſt. Our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall wants are many, our ſpirituall wants are more, and if Chriſt don't ſupply them, who will? who can? Nay our wants are ſo many, and ſo great, that Chriſt himſelfe could not ſupply them, were he not very, very rich.</p>
               <p>And thus I have given you a brief account of the Reaſons of the Point, <hi>Why the Lord Jeſus is held forth by the Scripture to be ſo very rich.</hi>

                  <p>I ſhall briefly run over this third branch, and ſo come to the Application, which is moſt in my eye, and upon my heart.

               </argument>
               <p>FIrſt, The riches of Chriſt are <hi>Incomparable riches.</hi> In <hi>Prov. 3. 13, 14, 15. Happy is the man that findeth wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> (that is, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt) <hi>and the man that get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth underſtanding; for the merchandize of it is better then the merchandize of ſilver, and the gaine thereof then fine gold. She is more precious then Rubies, and all the things thou canſt deſire are not to be compared unto her:</hi> One grain of Grace is far beyond all the gold of <hi>Ophir,</hi> and all the ſilver of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> which is but the guts and garbidge of the earth. We may ſay of the riches of this world, compared with the riches of Chriſt, as <hi>Gideon</hi> ſometime ſaid of the Vintage of <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ezer, The gleanings of Ephraim are better then the Vintage of Abiezer.</hi> So the gleanings, the ſmalleſt gatherings of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Chriſt, are far better, more excellent, more ſatisfying, more contenting, and more raviſhing, then all the riches of this world.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Pheraulas</hi> a poor man, on whom <hi>Cyrus</hi> beſtowed ſo much, that he knew not what to doe with his riches, being wearied out with care in keeping of them, he deſired rather to live quietly, though poor, as he had done before, then to poſſeſſe all thoſe riches with diſcontent; therefore he gave away all his wealth, deſiring onely to enjoy ſo much as might ſupply his neceſſities.

               <p>Secondly, the riches of Chriſt are <hi>Inexhauſtible riches,</hi> as

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, The riches of Chriſt are <hi>Soule-ſatisfying riches.</hi> O thoſe riches of grace and goodneſſe that be in Chriſt, how doe they ſatisfie the ſoules of ſinners? A Pardon doth not more ſatisfie a condemned man, nor bread the hungry man, nor drink the thirſty man, nor cloaths the naked man, nor health the ſick man, then the riches of Chriſt doe ſatisfie the gracious man. <hi>John 4. 13, 14. Whoſoever drinketh of this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſhall thirſt againe, but whoſoever drinketh of the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall never thirſt, but the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall be in him a well of living water, ſpringing up to everlaſting life.</hi> Grace is a perpetuall flowing fountaine: Grace is compared to water, water ſerves to coole men when they are in a burning heat, ſo Grace cooles the ſoule when it

                  <hi>and it ſufficeth us,</hi> John 14. 8. But now earthly riches can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſatisfie the ſoule, but as they ſaid once of <hi>Alexander, That had he a body ſutable to his minde, he would ſet one foot upon ſea, and the other upon land, he would reach the Eaſt with one hand, and the Weſt with the other.</hi> And doubtleſſe the ſame frame of ſpirit is to be found in all the Sons of <hi>Adam.</hi> In <hi>Eccleſ. 5. 10. He that loves ſilver, ſhall not be ſatisfied with ſilver, nor he that loveth abundance, with increaſe: This is alſo vanity.</hi> If a man be hungry, ſilver cannot feed him; if naked, it cannot cloath him; if cold, it cannot warm him; if ſick, it cannot recover him, much leſſe then is it able to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him. Oh! but the riches of Chriſt are <hi>Soule-ſatisfying riches.</hi> A ſoule rich in ſpiritualls, rich in eternalls, ſayes, I have enough, though I have not this and that temporall good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, The riches of Chriſt are <hi>Harmleſſe riches;</hi> they are riches that will not hurt the ſoule, that will not harme the ſoule. Where is there a ſoule to be found in all the world,

O the ſoules that riches have pierced thorow and thorow with many ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes! O the minds that riches have blinded! O the hearts that riches have hardened! O the conſciences that riches have benummed! O the wills that riches have perverted! O the affections that riches have diſordered and deſtroyed!

When mens conſciences are inlightned, and awakened, then they cry out, What are all theſe worldly riches to us, except we had an intereſt in the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Chriſt? As <hi>Abſolom</hi> once ſaid, <hi>What are all theſe to me, except I ſee the Kings face?</hi>

               <p>They can never pacifie Divine wrath.</p>
               <p>Nor they can never quiet a guilty conſcience.</p>

               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:168177:124"/>
               <p>For the firſt, By way of Motive, I ſhall onely propound theſe following Conſiderations, to provoke your ſoules to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be rich in grace, <hi>Laborandum,</hi> was one of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Motto, and muſt be every Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Conſider, <hi>That the more rich the ſoule is in grace, the higher the ſoule will be in joy and comfort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis the greateſt meaſures of grace, that uſher in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt

                  </note> meaſure of joy and comfort into a believing heart. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, have you taſted of the Conſolations of God? Have you at times ſate downe and drank of theſe wells of ſalvation? Are your hearts carried out for more of thoſe waters of life? Then labour to be rich in grace. A little Star yeelds but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle light, and a little grace will yield but a little comfort; but great meaſures of grace will yield a man not onely a Heaven hereafter, but alſo a Heaven of joy here. Divine comfort is a choyce Flower, a precious Jewel, and onely to be found in their boſomes that are rich in grace. Spirituall comforts are ſuch Strong-waters, that weak Chriſtians are not able to bear them. Great meaſures of grace carry with them the greateſt evidence of the truth of grace, and the clearer evidence there is in the ſoule of the truth of grace, the higher will joy and comfort ſpring. The ſoule is apt to hang her comforts on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hedge, to ſhift and ſhark in every bye corner for comfort; but as aire lights not without the Sun, and as fuell heats not without fire, ſo neither can any thing ſoundly comfort a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, without the God of grace, without his being rich in grace. Great meaſures of grace carry with them the greateſt evidence of a mans union and communion with God; and the more a mans union and communion with God is evidenc't, the more
<note place="margin">

In great meaſures of grace, as in a Chriſtall glaſſe, the ſoule ſees the glorious face of God ſhining and ſparkling, and this fills the ſoule with joy. <hi>Acts 9. 31.

                  <hi>If one drop of the joy of the Holy Ghoſt ſhould fall into hell, it would ſwallow up all the torments of hell,</hi> ſaith <hi>Austin.</hi> Oh! who would not then labour to increaſe in grace, that he may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in joy? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Promiſe lyes moſt fair before their eyes that are rich in grace, their intereſt in it is moſt clear, and rarely that they goe without it, unleſſe it is by taking part ſometimes with Satan againſt their intereſt in Chriſt; or ſomtimes through the power of unbelief, which indeed cuts off all the comfort of the ſoule, or by looking after other lovers, or by not heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the voyce of the Comforter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Chriſtians, you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten complaine of the want of joy and comfort, oh! doe but abound in grace, and you won't complaine of the want of comfort. <hi>Without delight the ſoule cannot live</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>take away all delight, and the ſoul dyes.</hi> Let this that ha's been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, provoke every Chriſtian to labour to be rich in grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>But ſecondly, Conſider this, <hi>You have ſingular opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and choyce advantages to be rich in grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a price put into your hands, but where are your hearts? In former times God gave out grace by drops, but now by Flaggons. Opportunities, if not improved, will, as

The thoughts of this will one day be the Scorpions that will vex thee, the rod that will laſh thee, the thornes that will prick thee, and the worm that will gnaw thee. <hi>The Storke</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>knowes</hi>

                  </note> who were rich in grace, have Crownes of honour ſet upon their heads, their names live, and are a ſweet ſavour to this very day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So in <hi>Pſal. 112. 6. The righteous ſhall be had in everlaſting remembrance, but the name of the wicked ſhall rot.</hi> The great mans name, and the rich mans name ſhall rot, ſaith he, but <hi>the name of the righteous ſhall be had in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting remembrance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Perſians</hi> uſe to write their Kings names in golden Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, ſo the Lord writes the names of ſoules rich in grace, in golden Characters: Their names are alwayes Heires to their lives; believe it, there's no ſuch way in the world, to have immortall names, like this of growing rich in grace. One man thinks to make his name immortall, by making himſelf great, another by heaping up ſilver and gold, as the duſt of the
<note place="margin">A good name yields a fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant ſmell o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Towne &amp; Country, it puts a ſhining luſtre upon the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, it fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to any publick em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, in Miniſtry or Magiſtracy; it ſtops many a foul mouth, and it makes men live <hi>when</hi> they are dead.</note> earth, or the ſtones of the ſtreet, and another by doing ſome ſtrange exploites, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But for all this the Lord will make good his word, <hi>The name of the wicked ſhall rot,</hi> if God be God; his name muſt rot; but <hi>the righteous ſhall be had in everlaſting remembrance,</hi> they leave their Names behind for a bleſſing, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 15. 'Tis ſad to conſider what many poor carnall Creatures have done, and ſuffered, to make their names immortall. The <hi>Romans</hi> deſires of praiſe and a name, made them bountifull of their purſes, and prodigall of their lives.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Erostratus</hi> ſet the Temple of <hi>Diana</hi> on fire, on that night that <hi>Alexander</hi> was borne, onely that he might be talked of when he was dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Calvin</hi> obſerves, That <hi>Servetus</hi> in <hi>Geneva,</hi> in the yeare 1555. gave all his Goods to the poore, and his body to be burned, and all for a name, for a little glory among men. But theſe poore Creatures have all miſt the mark. There's no way, Chriſtians, to have your names immortall, like this, of growing rich in grace. Satan nor the world ſhall never be able to bury ſuch mens names, who are rich in grace; their names ſhall riſe in glory here, as well as their bodies hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:168177:126"/>
               <p>But then fourthly, and mainly, Conſider, <hi>That ſpirituall riches will inable you to live up to your Principles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That man that hath but ſo much grace as will keep hell and his ſoule aſunder, will never live up to his Principles. Soules weak in grace are too apt to deny, and in their practices to contradict their owne Principles; and oh that this age could not furniſh us with too many inſtances of this nature! Oh! what's that that is the reproach of Religion, and the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, and the Goſpel, but this, that Profeſſors live below their Principles, that they live not up to their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples? And, let me tell you, Chriſtians, there is nothing but a rich meaſure of grace that will inable a ſoule to live up to his Principles. A man that is not rich in grace, will never be able to live up to his owne Principles, but will upon every occaſion and temptation, be ready to wound two at once, the honour of God, and his owne ſoule. Yea, men that are not rich in grace, will be ready to deny their owne Principles, as many weak Chriſtians did in perſecuting times.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay to me, <hi>What are thoſe gracious and holy Principles, that a rich meaſure of grace will inable a man to live up to?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will inſtance onely in thoſe that have moſt worth and weight in them, and they are worthy of all your thoughts.</p>
               <p>Firſt, 'Tis your Principle, that</p>
               <q>You must rather ſuffer, then ſin.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1 Principle."/>
               </q>
               <p>'Tis your Principle rather to undergo the greateſt Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<note place="margin">'Tis better for me to be a Martyr, then a Monarch, ſaid <hi>Ignatius,</hi> when he was to ſuffer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> then willingly to commit the leaſt iniquity. Now pray tell me, what will inable a Chriſtian to live up to this Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, will a little grace, a little knowledge of God a little faith in God, a little love to God, a little zeale for God, a little communion with God? will this doe it? Surely no. It muſt be much grace that muſt inable the ſoule to live up to this Principle. When ſin and ſuffering have ſtood in competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, many weak Chriſtians have choſen rather to ſin, then
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:168177:126"/> to ſuffer, which ha's open'd many a mouth, and ſadded many a heart, and wounded many a conſcience: Yea, ſuch by their not ſuffering, have ſuffered more then ever they could have ſuffered from the wrath and rage of man. Oh! but now ſpirituall riches will inable a man to live up to this Principle, as you may ſee in <hi>Daniel,</hi> who had an excellent ſpirit in him,
<note place="margin">Dan. 6.</note> who was rich in grace, and filled with the Holy Ghoſt, he lives up to his Principles, he lives out his Principles, when he was put hard to it, when he muſt either neglect the worſhip of his God, and make a God of his King, or to the Lyons
<note place="margin">Of the very ſame ſpirit were the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, they choſe rather to be thrown to Lyons without, then left to luſts within. <hi>Ad Leonem magis quam Leonem,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi>
                  </note> Den. Now <hi>Daniel</hi> chooſes rather to be caſt into the Lyons Den, then not to doe homage to his God: He had rather ſuffer much, then that God ſhould looſe a dram of his glory. Of the ſame ſpirit and mettle were thoſe Worthies, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. who when they were put to it, did rather chooſe to ſuffer the very worſt of miſeries, then they would in the leaſt diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Lord, wound their owne conſciences, and make work for repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo did <hi>Jovinian, Euſebius, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liatius, Baſil, Vincentius, Balilas,</hi> &amp;c. By all which you ſee, That Chriſtians that are ſpiritually rich, live up to this Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>viz. To ſuffer rather then ſin,</hi> when ſin and ſuffering ſtand in competition, which Babes in grace cannot doe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, 'Tis your Principle,</p>
               <q>That Grace and Virtue is to be purſued after, for its owne
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2 Principle."/> worth, beauty, and excellency.</q>
               <p>But pray tell me, what will carry a Chriſtian out to this Principle? Will a little grace carry a man out to purſue after grace, for the beauty, holineſſe, excellency, and ſpirituality that is in it? Alaſſe, we ſee by daily experience, that it will not doe it: All other conſiderations put together, are little enough to draw men on to purſue after grace for its native beauty and excellency. Many ſeek Chriſt, but 'tis for loaves
<note place="margin">John 6. 26.</note> more then for love; and they purſue after the means of grace, not for the beauty, excellency, and glory that's ſtampt apon the means, but one to maintaine his honour, and another to keep up his name, and another to bring in credit or cuſtome,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:168177:127"/> and another to pleaſe his friends, and another to ſilence his conſcience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But few there be (if any) but thoſe that are rich in grace, that are true to this Principle, that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue after grace, for its owne beauty and excellency. It was a notable expreſſion of <hi>David,</hi> who was a man rich in grace, <hi>Pſal. 119. 140. Thy word is very pure, therefore thy ſervant loveth it.</hi> Oh! for a ſoule to love grace, and the word of grace, for its owne intereſt, for the holineſſe, purity, and glory of it, this ſpeaks out the ſoule to be rich in grace. So <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note> a man rich in grace, purſues after grace for its owne intereſt, for the beauty and excellency of it: He <hi>forgets what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and preſſes forward after the marke for the price of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus, that if by any means he might attaine to the reſurrection of the dead.</hi> That is, to that perfection that the dead ſhall reach to in the morning of the reſurrection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The young Philoſophers were very forward to get the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of their Sect, and the rules of ſeverity, that they might diſcourſe with Kings and Nobles, not that they might reforme their owne manners. Many Profeſſors in this age are like thoſe
<note place="margin">There may be <hi>Malum opus in bono materia,</hi> as in <hi>Jehu's</hi> zeale, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> Philoſophers, they are very induſtrious to get knowledge, that they may be able to diſcourſe, and that they may be eyed, owned, and honoured among others, for their knowledge and underſtanding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But now ſoules that are rich in grace, they labour after greater meaſures of grace, out of love to grace, and becauſe of an excellency that they ſee in grace. Grace is a very ſparkling Jewel, and he that loves it, and purſues after it for its owne native beauty, ha's much of it within him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, 'Tis your Principle,</p>
               <q>That men muſt ſubject themſelves, and ſquare all their
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3 Principle."/> actions by the word of God.</q>

Leſſons of Muſick, and Copies, muſt not be read onely, but acted alſo: Soules rich in grace, are good at this, and they will be good in all places, and caſes: They are as good at the particular Duties of Religion, as at thoſe that are more generall; they are good Fathers, and good Maſters, and good Husbands, as well as good Chriſtians in a more generall ſenſe. But now ſoules that have but a little grace, they are much in the generall Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Religion, but very defective in the particular Duties of Religion, as ſad experience does abundantly evidence. Thoſe that have a blemiſh in their eye, think the skie to be ever cloudy; and nothing is more common to weak ſpirits, then to be criticiſing and contending about others Duties, and to neglect their owne. But ſuch that are rich in grace, make it their glory to ſubject themſelves to the rule of righteouſneſs: As <hi>Baldaſſer</hi> a German Miniſter, cryed out, <hi>Let the word of the Lord come, let it come</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and we will ſubmit to it, if we had many hundred necks to put under.</hi> It muſt be much grace that muſt inable a man freely, fully, and ſweetly to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject himſelfe and his actions, to the word of the Lord.</p>

<note place="margin">'Tis a baſe &amp; unworthy ſpirit for a man to make himſelfe the Centre of all his actions.

Oh but will a little grace inable a man to live up to this Principle? Wofull experience ſhewes the contrary. I but now, take me a man that is rich in grace, and he will live up to this golden Principle, as you may ſee in <hi>Nehem. 5. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. Nehemiah</hi> was a man emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in grace, and he chooſes rather to live upon his owne Purſe, then upon the publick purſe. <hi>Moreover, from the time that I was appointed to be their Governour in the Land of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, from the twentieth year, even unto the thirty-ſecond year of Artaxerxes the King, that is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the Governour: Behold the former Governours that had been before me, were chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beſides forty She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckles of ſilver, yea, even their ſervants did bear rule over the people, but ſo did not I becauſe of the fear of God; yea, alſo I continued in the worke of this wall, neither bought we any land, and all my ſervants were gathered thither unto the worke. Moreover, there were at my Table an hundred and fifty of the Jewes and Rulers, beſides thoſe that came in to us from among the Heathen: And yet for all this</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I required not the bread of the Governour, becauſe the bondage was heavy upon the people.</hi> Oh! here was a brave ſpirit indeed; he was far from inriching himſelfe by others ruines, from emptying o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Purſes, to fill his owne. But he is dead, and it ſeemes this brave ſpirit is buried with him; there are few of his name, and fewer of his ſpirit (if any) in this world; and therefore well might he pray, <hi>Thinke upon me my God for good, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all that I have done for this people:</hi> And accordingly God did think upon him for good, and made him very famous and glorious in his Generation. And that's a remarkable paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage concerning <hi>Moſes, Numb.</hi> 14. 12. to 21. <hi>I will ſmite</hi>

Therefore let me alone to deſtroy them, and cut them off, for they are a rebellious Generation: And I will make thee a mighter Nation for honour, riches, and power, then they. Nay,</hi> ſaith <hi>Moſes, this may not be Lord.</hi> Oh the people muſt be ſpared, the people muſt be pardoned, and the people muſt have thy preſence with them, and rather then it ſhould be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, let my name, Lord, be blotted out of the Book of life. Lord, I care not how ill it goes with my particular, ſo long as it may goe well with the generall; let me dye, ſo they may live: Can the ſelf-ſeekers of our age, think ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of this, and not bluſh?</p>
               <p>So <hi>Mordecai</hi> was a man of a brave publick ſpirit, <hi>Eſther 10. 3. Mordecai the Jew was next unto King Ahaſſuerus, and great among the Jewes, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren, ſeeking the wealth of his people:</hi> Or as the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew ha's it, <hi>Seeking good for his people.</hi> That is, he made it his buſineſſe to ſeek their good.

                  </note> and had a brave publick ſpirit, he laid out himſelfe, and laid downe himſelfe for a publick good, and ſo did <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp;c. Few in our dayes are of his opinion and minde, <hi>who was rather willing to beautifie Italy, then his owne houſe.

Friends, 'tis not a little grace that will make a man prefer the publick good, above his owne particular good, but much grace will; therefore labour to be rich in grace.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, 'Tis your Principle,</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:168177:129"/>That you are to doe the Duties that God requires of you, and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5 Principle."/> quietly leave the iſſues and events of all, to the wiſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God.</q>
               <p>But pray tell me, Will a little Grace inable a man to live up to this Principle? To do his duty, and to leave iſſues and events to him to whom they belong? Surely no. <hi>Eccl. 9. 10. Whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thy hand findeth to doe, doe it with all thy might, for there is no worke, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wiſedome in the grave whither thou goeſt.</hi> Mark, he does not ſay, what thy <hi>hand</hi> finds to doe, for that may find a thouſand things; nor what thy <hi>heart</hi> finds to doe, for that may find ten thouſand things; but what thy <hi>hand</hi> finds to doe, that is, look what work God cuts out to thy hand to doe, that <hi>doe with all thy might, for there is no working in the grave.</hi> We are to doe much good in a little time, we are made here, and ſet to be a doing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that may doe us good a thouſand years hence, yea, that may ſtand us in ſtead to eternity; our time is ſhort, our task is great. The Devil knowes that his time is but ſhort, and that's the reaſon why he is ſo active and ſtirring, why he doth outwork the Children of light, in a quick diſpatch of the deeds of darkneſſe. Chriſtians, don't deceive your ſelves, 'tis not ſhewes of grace, nor little meaſures of grace, that will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a man to live up to this Principle, but great meaſures of grace will, as you may ſee in the 3 Children, <hi>We are not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to anſwer thee O King in this matter, if it be ſo, our God whom we ſerve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, and he will deliver us out of thine hands, O King. But if not, be it knowne unto thee, O King, that we will not ſerve thy Gods, nor worſhip the golden Image which thou haſt ſet up.</hi> We know our Duty, and that we will keep to, what ever the iſſue and event be. So thoſe Worthies, <hi>Pſ. 44. Though thou haſt ſore broken us in the place of Dragons, and covered us with the ſhadow of death, yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falſly in thy Covenant.</hi> Here was much of Chriſt &amp; grace within. So in <hi>Acts</hi> 21. when <hi>Paul</hi> was to goe up to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> to ſuffer, his friends by many teares and Arguments
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:168177:129"/> laboured to diſſwade him, for feare of ſome ſad iſſue and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent that would follow: But <hi>Paul</hi> rich in grace, anſwered, <hi>What mean ye to weep, and breake my heart, for I am ready not to be bound onely, but alſo to dye at Jeruſalem, for the name of the Lord Jeſus: I muſt goe up to Jeruſalem, and I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to goe up, though I dye for it.</hi> I, here's a ſoule that lives up to his Principle; I, but now ſoules that are weak in grace (as
<note place="margin">Many of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have in this been like the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites,</hi> &amp;c.</note> we have had large experience of it in our times) they are more taken up, and buſied about the events and iſſues of things, then they are with their owne Duties: When they ſhould be a praying, a believing, a waiting, and acting for God, they have been a queſtioning, and fearing what the iſſue and event of this, and that, and the other thing would be: And indeed they have been high and low, as ſecondary cauſes have wrought, which hath made many of their lives a very hell. But now thoſe that are rich in grace, they ſay as once he did, <hi>Let us be of good courage, and let us play the men for our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and for the Cities of our God, and the Lord doe that which</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 10. 10, 11, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>ſeemeth him good.</hi> Let us doe our duties, and let the Lord doe as pleaſeth him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, 'Tis your Principle,</p>
               <q>That men are to be prepared, and to ſtand faſt againſt all
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6 Principle."/> ſuddaine aſſaults, and invaſions that may be made upon them.</q>
               <p>Many a valiant perſon dares fight in a Battell, or a Duell who yet will be timerous and fearfull, if ſuddenly ſurprized in a mid-night Alarum. Many precious ſoules, when they have time to conſider of the evill of ſin, the holineſſe of God, the eye of God, the honour of God, the glory of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, the joyes of the Saints, and the ſtopping of the mouths of ſinners, will rather dye, then ſin; they will rather ſuffer any thing, then doe the leaſt thing that may be a reproach to Chriſt: Oh! but when a ſudden occaſion or temptation is preſented, why, then they often fall, as <hi>David</hi> by chance ſpied <hi>Bathſheba</hi> waſhing her ſelfe, and falls before the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, he is conquered and carried captive by that ſudden oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:168177:130"/> But that's a more comfortable and conſiderable paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage that you have concerning <hi>Joſeph,</hi> in <hi>Gen. 49. 23, 24. The Archers ſorely grieved him</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>and ſhot at him, and hated him, but his Bow abode in ſtrength, and the armes of his hands were made ſtrong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob. Joſeph</hi> never wanted counſel nor courage, when he was at the worſt. Soules rich in grace (uſually) ſtand firme under the greateſt and ſuddeneſt preſſures, aſſaults, and invaſions, as you may ſee in <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 9, 12. and ſo the three Children; ſo <hi>Daniel;</hi> and ſo thoſe Worthies, <hi>Heb. 11. 35. They would not accept of deliverance, that they might obtaine a better reſurrection.</hi> Many ſudden aſſaults and attempts were made upon them, their enemies would faine have ſtormed them, and overcome them, ſometimes by gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den offers, ſometimes by terrible threats, but they are invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, nothing ſtirs them, nothing takes them. Really friends, it muſt be much grace that will make a man to live up to this Principle; and there's nothing that ſpeaks out more the ſtrength of Grace in a man, then his ſtanding againſt ſuddaine aſſaults and invaſions that by the Devil and the world are made upon him. You may talk of this, but without much grace you will never be able to doe it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, and laſtly, 'Tis your Principle,</p>
               <q>That your hearts are to be ready for every worke that God
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7 Principle."/> ſhall impoſe upon you.</q>
               <p>You are not to chooſe your imployment, neither are you to refuſe any imployment that God ſhall put upon you: You are alwayes to have an open eare, a ready hand, an obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent heart, and a willing cheerfull ſoule to fall in with what work or ſervice ſoever it is that God ſhall put upon you, this is your Principle. I, but tell me, Chriſtians, will a little grace inable a man to live up to this Principle? I judge not. You are to ſtand ready to change your imployment from better to worſe, if the Lord ſhall be pleaſed to order it ſo. You are to be ready to change your Crowne for a Croſſe; to change that imployment that's honourable, for that that's mean and
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:168177:130"/> low; and that which is more profitable, for that which is leſſe profitable; as it were from ruling of a Province, to the keeping of a Heard; from being a Lord, to be a ſervant; from being a ſervant to great men, to be a ſervant to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt ſervant, yea, to the pooreſt Beaſt. Certainly a little grace will never inable a man bravely and ſweetly to live up to this Principle. Their hearts that are poore in grace, are like a wounded hand or arme, which being but imperfectly cured, can onely move one way, and cannot turne to all poſtures, and all naturall uſes.</p>
               <p>Weak Chriſtians are very apt to three things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>To chooſe their mercies.</item>
                  <item>To chooſe their croſſes. And</item>
                  <item>To chooſe their imployments.</item>
               </list>
               <p>They are often unwilling that God himſelfe ſhould chooſe out their way or their work: But now ſoules that are rich in grace, they are at Gods beck and check, they are willing that God ſhall chooſe their work and their way, they are willing to be at his diſpoſe, to be high or low, to ſerve, or to be ſerved, to be ſomething, or to be nothing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now I beſeech you, Chriſtians, that you would ſeriouſly and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently remember this, <hi>That there is nothing in all the world that is ſuch an honour to God, and a glory to the Goſpel, as for Chriſtians to live up to their Principles; nor nothing ſuch a reproach to God, and his wayes, as this, for men to live below their Principles, and to act contrary to their Principles.</hi> And you will never be able to live up to your Principles, nor to live out your Principles, except you grow rich in grace; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore labour I ſay, labour as for life, to abound in Grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the fourth Motive is this, Conſider, <hi>That ſoules rich in Grace, are a mighty bleſſing to the Land and place where they live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are no ſuch bleſſings in the world, to Pariſhes, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Nations, as thoſe ſoules are, that are rich in Grace. Oh they are great bleſſings to all places where they come; they are perſons that are fit for the higheſt and nobleſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; there is not the higheſt work that is too high
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:168177:131"/> for a man that is rich in grace; not the hotteſt work that is too hot for a man rich in grace; nor the loweſt work be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a man rich in Grace: Such a man will not ſay, <hi>I would doe it, but that 'tis below my place, my blood, my parts, my education.</hi> May Chriſt have honour? May others have good? if ſo, I will doe it, ſaith the ſoule that's rich in Grace. What ever comes of it, and bleſſe God for the opportunity. In <hi>Dan. 6. 3. Then this Daniel was preferred above the Preſidents and Princes, becauſe an excellent ſpirit was in him, and the King thought to ſet him over the whole Realme.</hi> Why was <hi>Daniel</hi> ſet upon the Throne? but becauſe there was a glorious excellent ſpirit in him, that fitted him for the higheſt imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So <hi>Joſeph</hi> was a bleſſing to his Maſters family, and the people among whom he liv'd. No ſuch bleſſings to people and places, as ſoules rich in Grace. So in <hi>Nehem. 7. 2. I</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Such a one will be <hi>Pater patriae,</hi> Father of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</note> 
                  <hi>gave my Brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the place, charge over Jeruſalem,</hi> (and why he?) <hi>for he was a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man, and feared God above many.</hi> Oh the wiſedome, the prudence, the zeale, the courage, the compaſſion, the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the ſelf-denyall that ſhould be in Magiſtrates! There is a truth in that old Maxime, <hi>(Magistratus virum indicat) Magistracy will try a man.</hi> None fit to rule, but ſuch that are rich in Grace. What a world of good may a man doe with worldly riches, in a Pariſh, in a City, in a Nation? but that's nothing to the good that a man may doe that is rich in grace: Oh the ſins that he may prevent! Oh the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that he may divert! Oh the favours and bleſſings that he may draw downe upon the heads and hearts of people! I preſume you forget not what a bleſſing <hi>Moſes, Joſeph, Job, Nehemiah, Mordecai,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> proved to the people among whom they liv'd, and theſe were all rich in grace. A man rich in wiſedome, rich in faith, rich in goodneſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oh! what a bleſſing may he prove to ignorant ſoules, to ſtaggering ſoules, to wandring ſoules, to tempted ſoules, to deſerted ſoules? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Look what the Sun is to us, that may a ſoule rich in grace, be to others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oh friends! would you be bleſſings to your families? would you be bleſſings to the City, to the Nation? Oh then labour to be rich in
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:168177:131"/> Grace, and doe not think it enough that you have ſo much Grace as will keep you from dropping into hell, and that will bring you to heaven; but labour to be rich in grace, and then you will prove indeed a bleſſing to the place and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion where you live.</p>

'Tis true, that naturall and morall indowments will inable men to doe much, but grace will inable men to doe ten thouſand times more. There's no work too high nor too hard for ſouls rich in Grace; and therefore as you would be choyce inſtruments in the Lords hand, and eminently ſerviceable in your Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, O labour to be rich in Grace.

                  </note> to have a great name to live, and yet to have but a little life, is a ſtroak of ſtroaks; to be high in name, and little in worth, is a very ſad and ſore judgement; to have a name to be an eminent Chriſtian, and yet to be poor in faith, in love, in wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, in knowledge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is the greateſt unhappineſſe in the world. This ſtroak is upon many in theſe dayes; but that which is ſaddeſt of all, is this, they feele it not, they obſerve it not; but now he that is rich in grace, hath ſomething
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:168177:132"/> within, that will beare him out under a great name in the world.</p>
               <p>Againe, A great meaſure of Grace will bear you out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der great deſires, as well as under a great name. A man that's rich in Grace, may ask what he pleaſes, he is one much in with God, and God will deny him nothing; the beſt of the beſt is for this man, he may have any thing, he may have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing that heaven affordeth, is able to improve much, and therefore he may ask much, and have it.</p>
               <p>'Twas a ſweet ſaying of one, <hi>O Lord, I never come to thee but by thee; I never goe from thee without thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sozonem</hi> ſaith of <hi>Apollonius, That he never asked any thing of God, but he had it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And another ſpeaking of <hi>Luther,</hi> ſaith, <hi>(Hic homo potuit apud Deum quod voluit) He could have what he would of God.</hi> Rich men may long for this and that, and have it, they have ſomething that will fetch it, but poor men may not. Oh, now who would not labour as for life, to be rich in Grace? Oh this will bear you out under great means, and under great names, and under great deſires; therefore reſt not ſatisfied with a little Grace.</p>
               <p>But then ſixthly, and laſtly, <hi>Soules rich in Grace are the honour of Christ, and the glory of Christianity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As 'tis the glory of the ſtock, when the Grafts grow and thrive in it, even ſo it is the glory of Chriſt when thoſe that are ingrafted into him, thrive, and grow: This declares to all the world, that Chriſt keeps a good houſe, and that he doth not feed his Children with traſh, but with the choiſeſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, that he is open-handed, and free-hearted. 'Tis the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the father, when the Child growes rich under him; and the glory of the Maſter, when the Servant growes rich under him; and ſo 'tis the glory of Chriſt, when poore ſoules grow rich under him. The name of Chriſt, and the honour of Chriſt is kept up in this world, by ſouls that are rich in grace; they are the perſons that make others think well, and ſpeak well of Chriſt. You may at your leiſure read the firſt and ſecond Epiſtles to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> and there you ſhall ſee what an honour they were to the Lord Jeſus, and the Goſpel,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:168177:132"/> who abounded in ſpirituall riches. Such Chriſtians that are like to <hi>Pharoah's</hi> leane Kine, reproach three at once, God, the Goſpel, and their Teachers: And this Age is full of ſuch Chriſtians. 'Tis your greateſt work in this world, to keep up the honour and the glory of the Lord, and this you can never, you will never doe, except you labour to be rich in Grace: Let others <hi>labour for the meat that periſheth,</hi> doe you <hi>labour for that which endureth to everlasting life.</hi> When you come to dye, and when you come to make up your Accounts, 'twill never be a grief (but a joy) unto you, that you have made it your greateſt buſineſſe and work in this world, to be rich in Grace.</p>
               <p>But here you may ſay,</p>
               <p>What Meanes muſt we uſe, that we may grow rich in Grace?</p>
               <p>I Anſwer.</p>

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:168177:137"/> by driving of a ſecret Trade heavenwards. 'Tis true, it's good for men to attend upon this, and that, and the other publick adminiſtration; for in all Divine adminiſtrations God ſhewes his beauty and glory; I, but ſuch that delight to be more

The beſt wine, the beſt dainties and delicates, are for ſuch: And I never knew any man or woman in my life, that was richer in grace, then thoſe that were much in cloſet communion with God. Much of a Chriſtians ſpirituall ſtrength lyes in ſecret prayer, as <hi>Sampſon's</hi> did in his haire. Nothing charmes Satan, and weakens ſin, like this: Secret Prayers are the pillars of ſmoke wherein the ſoule aſcendeth to God out of the wilderneſſe of this world. Secret prayer is <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ladder, where you have God diſcending downe into the ſoul, and rhe ſoule ſweetly aſcending up to God. No way to be rich in ſpirituals like this, therefore be ſure to maintaine and keep up a ſecret Trade between God and your owne ſoules: Oh let God heare often of you in ſecret. In <hi>Cant. 7. 5. The King is held in the Galleries.</hi> Oh! in the ſecret walks, the ſoule meets with the King of glory: Oh! there the ſoule hangs upon Chriſt, there the ſoule ſucks and drawes virtue from Chriſt, and there the ſoule is made rich with the riches of Chriſt, Chriſt is much delighted and taken with ſecret pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. <hi>Cant. 2. 14. O my Dove that art in the clefts of the rock, in the ſecret places of the ſtaires</hi> (that art got into a hole) <hi>let me heare thy voyce, let me ſee thy countenance; for ſweet is thy voyce, and thy countenance is lovely.</hi> Secret meales are very fatning, and ſecret duties are very ſoule-inriching.

               <argument>
                  <p>And the firſt Propoſition is this.</p>
               </argument>
               <q>ALL that doe grow rich in Grace, they grow rich gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually.</q>
               <p>The Sun aſcends by degrees; Children, Plants, and Trees, they grow by degrees; ſo doe Saints in ſpiritualls. It's true, many men as to temporalls, by the death of ſome friend, or this or that providence, grow rich on a ſuddaine: But no ſoule that's rich in grace, but growes rich gradually. In <hi>Prov. 4. 18. But the path of the juſt is like the ſhining light, that ſhineth more and more unto the perfect day.</hi> He proceeds from virtue to virtue, untill at length he ſhines like the Sun in its ſtrength. And ſo in <hi>Mal. 4. 2. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you that feare my name, ſhall the Sun of righteouſneſſe ariſe with heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under his wings; and you ſhall goe forth and grow up as Calves of the ſtall.</hi> Hoſ. 14. 5, 1, 7. <hi>I will be as the dew unto Iſrael, he ſhall grow as the Lilly, and caſt forth his roots as Lebanon. His branches ſhall ſpread, and his beauty ſhall be as the Olive-tree, and his ſmell as Lebanon. They that dwell under his ſhadow ſhall returne, they ſhall revive as the corne, and grow as the Vine: The ſent thereof ſhall be as the wine of Lebanon.</hi> I ſhall but hint at this now, becauſe I have ſpoken more fully to it already, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond Propoſition is this.</p>
               <q>Few or none are rich in all Graces.</q>
               <p>There are ſome men in the world that are generally rich, that are rich in money, and rich in land, and rich in goods. But where you have one man that is a generall rich man in this ſenſe, you have ten thouſand that are onely rich in ſome one thing, as Money, Goods, or Land, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo it is here. 'Tis a hard thing (if poſſible) to find a ſoule that's generally rich: That is, rich in every grace, that's rich in faith, and rich in wiſedome, and rich in love, and rich in patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:168177:138"/> 
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> was rich in Faith, and <hi>Job</hi> was rich in Patience, and <hi>Moſes</hi> was rich in Meekneſſe, and <hi>David</hi> was rich in zeale, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but none of theſe were rich in every grace. And ſo in theſe dayes you may find one Chriſtian rich in one grace, and another Chriſtian rich in another grace, but where will you find a Chriſtian that is rich in every grace? Such that are rich in ſome graces, are yet very defective and lame in other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
<note place="margin">No grace growes alike in all Saints. In the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſome brought forth thirty, ſome ſixty, ſome a hundred, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> The Saints once at <hi>Rome</hi> were richer in wiſedome and knowledge, then the Saints at <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> Rom. 15. 14. And the Saints at <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> were richer in faith, love, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and charity, then the Saints at <hi>Rome,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 1. 4. 2. 8. compared with 2 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 1. 3, 4. It is with Saints, as with ſinners, one ſinner excells in one vice, another in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vice: So one Saint excells in one virtue, and another in another virtue; one is rich in joy, in comfort, another is rich in humility, in feare, another in faith and hope, and another in love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And mark how this ariſes.</p>
               <p>It ariſes ſometimes from hence, that every Saint doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to excell in that particular grace that is moſt oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to his boſome ſin: Now every Saints boſome ſin is not alike; it may be pride is one mans boſome ſin, and hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie another mans boſome ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now it's the very nature of grace to make a man ſtrive to be moſt eminent in that particular grace that is moſt oppoſite to his boſome ſin, and upon this account it comes to paſſe that one is rich in one grace, and another in another.</p>
               <p>Againe, Some Saints have frequent occaſions to act and exerciſe ſuch and ſuch graces; others are called forth to act ſuch and ſuch graces; now the more any particular grace is acted, the more that particular grace is increaſed; frequent acts cauſe a ſtronger habite both in graces and in ſins. If all Chriſtians ſhould be rich in all graces, what difference would there be between heaven and earth? what need would there be of Ordinances? and when would Chriſtians long to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third Propoſition is this.</p>
               <q>Soules may be rich in Grace, and yet not know it, and yet not perceive it.</q>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:168177:138"/>
               <p>The Child is Heire to a Crowne, to a great Eſtate, but
<note place="margin">The Sun a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends with out percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo 'tis often in this ſupernaturall motion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Greeks derive their word for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, from a root that ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies to burn.

Gen. 28.</note> knowes it not; <hi>Moſes</hi> his face did ſhine, and others ſaw it, but he perceived it not: So many a precious ſoule is rich in grace, and others ſee it, and know it, and bleſſe God for it, and yet the poore ſoule perceives it not: Now becauſe a right underſtanding of this, may be of much uſe to ſome ſadded de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected ſoules, I will ſhew you how this comes to paſſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Sometime it ariſes from the ſoules ſtrong deſires of ſpirituall riches. The ſtrength of the ſoules deſires after ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall riches, doth often take away the very ſence of growing ſpiritually rich. Many covetous mens deſires are ſo ſtrongly carried forth after earthly riches, that though they doe grow rich, yet they cannot perceive it, they cannot believe it: 'Tis juſt ſo with many a precious Chriſtian, his deſires after ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall riches are ſo ſtrong, that they take away the very ſence of his growing rich in ſpiritualls: Many Chriſtians have much worth within them, but they ſee it not. 'Twas a good man that ſaid, <hi>The Lord was in this place, and I knew it not,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Againe, This ariſeth ſometimes from mens neglecting the caſting up of their Accounts. Many men thrive, and grow rich, and yet by neglecting the caſting up of their Accounts, they cannot tell whether they goe backward, or forward: 'Tis ſo with many precious ſoules, they grow in grace, and are

               </p>
               <p>Againe, Sometimes it ariſeth from the ſoules too frequent caſting up of its Accounts. If a man ſhould caſt up his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts once a week, or once a moneth, he may not be able to diſcerne that he doth grow rich, and yet he may grow rich; but let him but compare one year with another, and he ſhall clearly ſee that he doth grow rich. Though moſt are to blame for neglecting the caſting up of their accounts, yet ſome are to blame for caſting up their accounts too often; for by this means they are not able to perceive their ſpirituall growth, and ſo can neither be ſo thankfull, nor ſo cheerfull as otherwiſe they might. Let there be ſome conſiderable time between your caſting up of your Accounts, and you will
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:168177:139"/> find that your ſoules are growne rich, though for the preſent you perceive it not.</p>
               <p>But then againe, Sometimes it ariſeth from the ſoules mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake in caſting up of its accounts. The ſoule many times mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, 'tis in a hurry, and there the ſoule puts downe ten for a hundred, and a hundred for a thouſand; as ſometimes men in hurrying over their Books, they ſlip and make miſtakes, and ſo they think there's nothing got, whereas indeed there's much got, and in the cloſe they ſhall find it ſo.

               <p>The fourth Propoſition is this.</p>
               <q>That Saints muſt indeavour to grow rich in every Grace.</q>
               <p>'Tis the duty and the glory of Saints, to indeavour to grow rich in every grace. So the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. to 12. <hi>Add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>
                  <hi>Grow in Grace,</hi> that is, grow in love, in faith, in humility, in meekneſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but eſpecially <hi>in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour,</hi> becauſe that was a ſpeciall remedy againſt the errors of thoſe times, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All the graces that be in you, are weak, and therefore you had need to ſtrengthen them all.</p>
               <p>Againe, You have the ſeeds of all corruptions in you, and is there any way to be rid of every ſin, but by thriving in every grace?</p>
               <p>Againe, You have opportunities as well to thrive in one grace, as in another.</p>

Don't a ſtate of proſperity beſpeak a man to be rich in wiſedome, rich in humility, rich in love, and rich in compaſſion? that his heart may be kept cloſe to God in that ſtate, and that he may doe nothing unworthy of God, who ha's done ſo much for him: And now when God ſhall change the manner of his adminiſtrations towards ſuch a man, when God ſhall put out his Candle, pull off his Robes, and cloath him with raggs, and ſet him, with <hi>Job,</hi> upon the dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, don't this condition beſpeak much patience, much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation, much ſelf-deniall, much faith? how elſe will this man bravely bear up, when God ſhall write ſuch bitter things againſt him, and paſſe the ſentence of death upon his neareſt, and his deareſt comforts?

As a growth in all the members of the body, renders the body moſt lovely and beautifull; the perfect beauty and comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the body riſes from the ſymmetry and fitneſſe of the parts unto one another. Rare and excellent beauty ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from the comelineſſe of all parts; if one part be come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and another deformed, then there is no perfect beauty. Well, remember this, there's no ſuch beautifull Chriſtians, as thoſe that grow rich in every grace: Oh! they are the beauty of Chriſt, the honour of the Goſpel, and the glory of Chriſtianity.</p>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:168177:140"/>
               <p>And ſo much for the fourth Propoſition, <hi>viz. That we muſt labour to be rich in every Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fifth Propoſition that I ſhall lay downe, is this.</p>
               <q>Saints ſhould labour more particularly, and more eſpecially to be rich in Faith.</q>
               <p>Though 'tis of concernment to believers, to be rich in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry grace, yet it is of ſpeciall concernment to them to labour to be rich in this particular grace of faith. In <hi>Jude, verſ. 20. Building up your ſelves in your moſt holy faith.</hi> 'Tis not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to have faith, but they muſt build up themſelves, and build up one another <hi>in their moſt holy faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are three things that the Scripture calls pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The Blood of Chriſt.</hi> In 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 19. Ye are not redeemed with ſilver, and gold, but with the Precious Blood of Chriſt, as of a Lamb without blemiſh, and without ſpot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>Promiſes</hi> are called <hi>Precious Promiſes. 2 Pet. 1. 4. Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and Precious Promiſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Faith</hi> is called <hi>Precious Faith.</hi> Verſ. 1. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us.</hi> Now though it be of concernment for every Saint to labour to be rich in every grace; yet more eſpecially, and more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to be rich in this Grace of faith, and that upon this account that followes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe that Faith is the ſoules greateſt and choy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt fence againſt her worſt enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Epheſ. 6. 16. Above all, take the ſhield of Faith, whereby yee may be able to quench all the firey darts of the wicked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Above all, take the ſhield of faith.</hi> Neglect no part of your Armour, but above all look to the ſhield of Faith. Look what the ſhield is to the body, that is Faith to a believers ſoule, to ſecure him againſt all the fierce and fiery darts of Satan.</p>
               <p>It is reported of Satan, that he ſhould ſay of a learned man,
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Tu me ſemper vincis.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Thou doeſt alwayes overcome me: When I would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt and promote thee, thou keepeſt thy ſelfe in humility; and</hi>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:168177:140"/> 
                  <hi>when I would throw thee downe, thou lifteſt thy ſelfe up in Aſſurance of faith.</hi> Faith makes the ſoule invincible, it makes the ſoule victorious, it leads captivity captive, it binds Satan in chaines, it foiles him at every weapon; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore above all labour to be rich in faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Growth in faith will advance the growth of all other Graces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All other graces thrive in the ſoule as faith thrives, and no otherwiſe; be rich in this, and be rich in all; be weak in this, and be weak in all. Faith hath an influence upon all other graces; it is like a ſilver threed, that runs through a Chaine of Pearles, it puts ſtrength and vivacity into all other graces. You never knew a man rich in any grace, that ha's not been rich in faith. Every mans hope, joy, feare, love, humility, patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is as his faith is. In <hi>Heb. 11. 1. Faith is the evidence of things not ſeene, and the ſubſtance of things hoped for.</hi> Or as the Greek ha's it, <hi>The ſubſiſtance of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>things hoped for.</hi> All other graces live upon faiths coſt and charge. Look what the breaſt is to the Child, wings to the bird, Oyle to the wheeles, and the ſoule to the body, that is faith to all other graces in the ſoule of man.</p>
               <p>It is reported of the <hi>Christall,</hi> that it hath ſuch a virtue in it, that the very touching of it quickens other ſtones, and puts a luſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and a beauty upon them. I am ſure 'tis true of faith, there is ſuch a Divine virtue and power in faith, that it will quicken and caſt a luſtre and a beauty upon all other graces in the ſoule of man; and therefore you ſhould labour as for life, to be rich in this particular grace of faith.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Conſider this, <hi>Of all Graces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that be in the ſoule of man, faith is the moſt uſefull grace, and therefore you ſhould above all labour to be rich in faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis a Chriſtians right eye, without which he cannot ſee for Chriſt; 'tis his right hand, without which he cannot doe for Chriſt; 'tis his tongue, without which he cannot ſpeak for Chriſt; 'tis his very vitall ſpirits, without which he cannot act for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Some ſay that King <hi>Midas</hi> had obtained of the Gods, that whatſoever he touch'd ſhould be turn'd into gold. I am ſure
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:168177:141"/> that whatever faith toucheth, it turnes into gold; that is, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our good. If our faith touches the Promiſes, it turns them into our good; whatſoever faith layes its hand upon, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriates to it ſelfe, and turnes it into the ſoules good. If
<note place="margin">Pſal 63. 1. Pſal. 89. 26. John 20 28.</note> faith looks upon God, it ſaith, <hi>This God is my God for ever and ever, and he ſhall be my guide unto death.</hi> When it looks upon Chriſt, it ſaith with <hi>Thomas, My Lord, and my God.</hi> When it looks upon the Crowne of righteouſneſſe, it ſaith, <hi>This Crowne is laid up for me,</hi> &amp;c. Faith is bread to nouriſh us, and wine to cheere us, and a Cordiall to ſtrengthen us. Faith is a ſword to defend us, a guide to direct us, a ſtaffe to ſupport us, a plaiſter to heale us, a friend to comfort us, and a golden key to open heaven unto us. Faith of all graces is the moſt uſefull grace to the ſoule of man. <hi>Without faith it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible</hi>

<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 2.</note> you make, and upon all the Sermons you hear, and upon all the teares you ſhed, and upon all the almes you give, if all be not managed by a hand of faith.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>You ſhould labour above all to be rich in faith, becauſe faith is that Princely Grace that Chriſt is moſt taken with.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cant. 4. 9. Thou haſt raviſhed my heart, my Siſter, my Spouſe, thou haſt raviſhed my heart with one, of thine eyes,</hi> (that is, with that piercing eye of faith that looks up to my Mercy-ſeat) <hi>with one Chaine of thy neck.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are two things that with open mouth ſpeake out Chriſt to be moſt taken with the faith of his people.</p>
               <p>And the firſt is, His uncrowning himſelfe, to Crowne his peoples faith. Chriſt doth often take the Crowne off his owne head, and puts it upon the head of faith, witneſſe ſuch paſſages as theſe (which are frequent in Scripture, <hi>Thy faith hath healed thee, Thy faith hath ſaved thee, Thy faith hath made thee whole,</hi> &amp;c. Chriſt takes the Crowne off his owne head, and puts it upon the head of faith; and no wonder, for of all graces, faith takes the Crowne off a mans owne head, and puts it upon the head of Chriſt. Man naturally is apt to Crowne any thing but Chriſt; he is apt to Crowne his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:168177:141"/> and Crowne his deſires, and Crowne his indeavours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oh but now faith acts like a King of Kings, and uncrownes all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſets the Crowne upon the head of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And then a ſecond thing that ſpeaks out Chriſt to be moſt taken with the grace of faith, is this, That he overlooks all other graces in compariſon of faith, as you may ſee in the <hi>Canaanite</hi> woman, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 21-29. The poore woman ſhewes a great deale of compaſſion, a great deale of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, a great deale of humility, a great deale of love, and a great deale of ſelf-deniall; but in the cloſe ſaith Chriſt, <hi>O woman greae is thy faith, be it unto thee even as thou wilt.</hi> He doth not ſay, O woman great is thy love, nor O woman great is thy wiſedome, nor O woman great is thy humility, and ſelf-deniall, nor O woman great is thy patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but <hi>O woman great is thy faith.</hi> He overlooks, as it were, all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther graces, and ſets the Crowne upon the head of faith, <hi>O woman great is thy faith.</hi> So in <hi>Mark</hi> 5. the woman that had a bloody iſſue twelve yeares, comes to Chriſt for cure, and in the cloſe of the ſtory, ſaith Chriſt to her, <hi>Woman, thy faith hath made thee whole.</hi> He doth not ſay, Woman, thy preſſing hard to come to me, hath made thee whole; but <hi>Thy faith hath made thee whole.</hi> He doth not ſay, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, thy earneſt deſires and indeavours to be made whole, ha's made thee whole, but <hi>Thy faith hath made thee whole.</hi> He doth not ſay, Woman, thy feare and trembling hath made thee whole, but <hi>Thy faith hath made thee whole,</hi> &amp;c. So in <hi>Luke 7. ult. Thy faith hath ſaved thee, goe in peace.</hi> Though ſhe wept much, and loved much, yet Chriſt doth not ſay, Thy teares have ſaved thee, thy ſorrow hath ſaved thee. He doth not ſay, Thy humility, thy charity hath ſaved thee; but <hi>O woman, thy faith hath ſaved thee.</hi> Chriſt overlooks all other graces, as it were, and caſts a lovely eye upon the grace of ſaith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then againe in the fifth place, <hi>You ſhould above all labour to be rich in faith, becauſe of all graces in the ſoule of man, faith makes him moſt lively and active.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There's no grace, I ſay, no grace in the ſoule of man that makes him ſo full of life and action, as the grace of faith.
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:168177:142"/> Faith is the <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> the firſt pin, the firſt wheele
<note place="margin">True faith puts forth it ſelf into vitall operations. <hi>Ferdinands</hi> of <hi>Arragon</hi> belie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ved the ſtory told him by <hi>Columbus,</hi> and therefore he furniſhed him with ſhips, &amp; got the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> by his faith in the undertaker But <hi>Henry the Seventh of England,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>m not, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore truſted him not with ſhipping, and ſo loſt all the purchaſe of that faith, which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe may yet be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, if the Lord ſhall pleaſe to own and crown the juſt and noble deſigne of Generall <hi>Pen,</hi> &amp;c.</note> that moves all the golden wheeles of obedience. In <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. you read what thoſe Worthies did, they left their Countrey, their kindred, upon a bare command of God. Faith hath <hi>Rachel's</hi> eye, but <hi>Leah's</hi> womb, it makes ſoules very fruitfull in wayes of well-doing. Faith is as the ſpring in the Watch, that moves the wheels; not a grace ſtirs, till faith ſets it on work. Faith is like <hi>Solomons</hi> virtuous woman, that ſets all her maidens to work. Faith ſets joy on work, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham deſired to ſee my day, and ſaw it, and rejoyced.</hi> Faith ſets love on work, <hi>It workes by love,</hi> Gal. 5. 6. It ſets hope on work, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 24, 25. It ſets godly ſorrow at work, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10. It ſets patience at work, I believe that God is wiſe and loving, and what he does is out of ſome noble deſigne to doe my ſoule good, this ſpins out patience. Faith fits a man to doe, to ſuffer, to waite, to walk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore labour above all to be rich in faith.</p>
               <p>And then ſixthly, <hi>Of all graces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> faith renders the ſoule moſt invincible, and therefore you ſhould labour above all, to be rich in faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It renders the ſoule invincible and unconquerable under all the hardſhips and tryalls it meets with in this world. Faith makes a man triumph in all the changes and conditions of this life. It was their faith that made them invincible in <hi>Dan. 3. 16, 17, 18. O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to anſwer thee in this matter, if it be ſo, our God whom we ſerve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O King. But if not, be it knowne unto thee, O King, that we will not ſerve thy Gods, nor worſhip thy golden Image which thou haſt up.</hi> And ſo <hi>Daniels</hi> faith ſtopt the Lyons mouths, it made him too ſtrong for the ſtrongeſt Beaſts of prey, as you may ſee in <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. Though the Enemies of a believer are very ſubtile, ſtrong, and experienced, and though the battell be hot and long, yet a ſoule rich in faith ſhall have the day. Faith will render a believer victorious in the cloſe; <hi>He may ſuffer death</hi> (as

               </p>
               <p>And then ſeventhly, <hi>Above all labour to be rich in faith, becauſe Satan will labour might and maine to weaken your faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh! the great deſigne of Satan is not ſo much to weaken you in externalls, as it is to weaken you in internalls. Satan can be contented that men ſhould have their heads full of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and their mouths full of Religion, and their baggs full of gold, and their cheſts full of ſilver, and their ſhops full of wares, ſo their ſoules be either voyd of faith, or but poor and low in faith. Satans greateſt plot is to weaken the faith of Chriſtians, <hi>Luke 22. 31, 32. And the Lord ſaid, Simon, Simon, behold Satan hath deſired to have you, that he may ſift</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Satan knowes that <hi>Nihil reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net qui fidem perdidit.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And then eighthly, <hi>Conſider this, of all graces faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes moſt to the bringing downe of mercies and bleſſings upon your ſelves and friends, and therefore you ſhould above all labour to be rich in this particular grace of faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Faith contributes to the bringing downe of bleſſings upon our ſelves. In <hi>Dan. 6. 23. Daniel was delivered</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>becauſe he believed in his God.</hi> 'Twas his faith, and
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:168177:143"/> not his prayers; 'twas his faith, and not his teares; 'twas his faith, and not his ſighes, that ſtopt the Lyons mouths, and wrought deliverance for him. So in <hi>Pſal. 27. 13. I had fainted unleſſe I had believed to ſee the goodneſſe of the Lord in the Land of the living.</hi> So in 2 <hi>Chron. 20. 20. Believe in the Lord your God, ſo ſhall ye be eſtabliſhed; believe his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, ſo ſhall ye proſper,</hi> and ſo they did. That's a very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Scripture to this purpoſe, 2 <hi>Chron. 13. 15, 16, 17. Then the men of Judah gave a ſhout, and as the men of Judah ſhouted, it came to paſſe that God ſmote Jeroboam and all Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Were men more rich in faith, they would be more rich in other bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>before Abijah and Judah, and the Children of Iſrael fled before Judah, and God delivered them into their hands: And Abijah and his people ſlew with a great ſlaughter, ſo there fell downe ſlaine of Iſrael five hundred thouſand choſen men.</hi> (Here was a dreadfull ſlaughter; no wars, no ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters comparable to thoſe the Scripture ſpeaks of.) And the reaſon is rendred, <hi>verſ. 18. Becauſe they relyed upon the Lord God of their fathers.</hi> And as faith is the onely way to bring downe a bleſſing upon our ſelves, ſo faith is the onely way to bring downe bleſſings upon our friends and relations. Though another man cannot be ſaved by my faith, yet he
<note place="margin">Gen. 39.</note> may be bleſt with many bleſſings, upon the account of my faith. In <hi>Mat. 15. 22. to</hi> 29. it was the <hi>Canaanitiſh</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans faith that brought a bleſſing of healing upon her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And ſo in <hi>Mat. 8. 6. to</hi> 14. the Centurions faith heal'd his ſervant <hi>that was ſick of a Palſie, and from that very houre he was healed.</hi> The ſervant got well by his Maſters faith. And ſo likewiſe in <hi>Mark</hi> 9. the faith of the father prevailed for the diſpoſſeſſing of his Son. <hi>If thou canſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>all things are poſſible: And the poore man ſaid with teares, Lord I believe, helpe my unbelief.

               </p>
               <p>And thus much for the fifth Propoſition: We come now to the ſixth Propoſition, and that is this.</p>
               <q>That no gracious ſoules doe at all times alike grow and thrive in ſpirituall riches.</q>
               <p>A Child ſometimes ſhootes up more in a month, then he doth at other times, in many months; and ſometimes more

                  </note> in a year, then he does afterwards in many years. So many a Chriſtian thrives more, and gets more ſpirituall riches in one moneth, then in many; in one year, then in many. I appeale to your experiences, Chriſtians, don't you find it ſo? I know you doe: To cite Scripture to prove this, would be to caſt water into the ſea, and to light Candles to ſee the Sun at noone. Sin and Satan doe ſometimes work more violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and more ſtrongly in the ſoules of Saints, then at other times. Now when ſin and Satan work moſt, and prevaile moſt, then grace thrives leaſt. As the life of grace, is the death of ſin, and the growth of grace, the decay of ſin, ſo the increaſe of ſin, is the decay of grace; and the ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<note place="margin">No ſhips have it all times the ſame gales of wind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> of ſin, is the weakning of grace.</p>
               <p>Againe, No Saints have at all times alike gales of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, and therefore they doe not grow in ſpirituall ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches at all times alike. A man thrives in ſpirituall riches as the gales of the ſpirit of God are upon him, and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe:
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:168177:144"/> When the ſpirit of the Lord doth blow moſt ſweetly
<note place="margin">Cant. 4. ult.</note> and ſtrongly upon his heart, then his graces thrive and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh moſt, then thoſe beds of ſpices doe yeeld the moſt fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant ſmell. But when the ſpirit of the Lord doth withdraw, and with-hold his influences, how does the ſtrength and glory
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Latimer</hi> ſaid of the Spirit, That 'tis co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and going, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> of grace, wither and decay?</p>
               <p>The Herb <hi>Heliotropium</hi> doth turne about, and open, and ſhut, according to the motion of the Sun, ſo doe the graces of the Saints according to the internall gales, motions, and operations of the ſpirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, No Saints have at all times the like externall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages and opportunities of growing rich in ſpiritualls. They have not the word, it may be, in that power and life, as formerly; or it may be they injoy not the communion of Saints, as formerly, or if they doe, yet perhaps thoſe that have formerly been as fire to warme and inflame them, are now become water to coole them, and deaden them; or it may be they have not thoſe advantages for Cloſet duties, as formerly; or it may be the courſe of nature is changed, and if ſo, 'tis no wonder that they thrive not in ſpiritulls, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. When Children have not as good food, and as good lodging, and as good looking after, as at other times, no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if they thrive not, as at other times. When men have not the ſame advantages and opportunites to grow rich in the world, as formerly, doe we wonder that they thrive not as before? Surely no.</p>
               <p>And ſometimes this ariſes from the breaking of ſome bone by ſin; <hi>David</hi> found it ſo. Many a man by breaking a bone
<note place="margin">Pſal. 50.</note> is much hindered from thriving in the world. O this broken arme, this broken legge, hath loſt me many a faire pound, which otherwiſe I might have got. O friends, ſin is the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the bones, the breaking of a mans peace and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<note place="margin">Iſa. 59. 1, 2. Chap. 64. 7. Gal. 6. 1.</note> with God; 'tis the breaking of his hope and confidence in God, 'tis the diſ-joyning of a man from God, and ſo it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders a mans ſpirituall growth. Believe it, Chriſtians, if you play and dally with ſin, if you fall in with ſin, if you make one with ſin, you will never grow rich in ſpiritualls. Sin will cauſe ſuch a breaking of bones, as will undoubtedly hinder
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:168177:145"/> the proſperity of your ſoules. And ſo much for the ſixth Propoſition.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh and laſt Propoſition I ſhall propound, is this. <hi>A man may grow rich in thoſe Graces that are more remote from Chriſt, that are leſſe converſant about Chriſt, when he doth not grow rich in thoſe Graces, that, as ſpeciall favourites, ſtand alwayes at the elbow of Chriſt, and are moſt buſied and converſant about Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let me open it thus to you.</p>
               <p>You know at Court there are ſome that have the honour to attend alwayes at the Princes elbow; and there are others that appertaine to the ſame Prince, but are more remote in their imployments for him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So in the ſoule, there are ſome graces that are more remote, and not ſo converſant about the perſon of Chriſt, as now Humility, Self-denyall, Patierce, Meekneſſe, Temporance, Sobriety, and the like. Now though theſe graces doe appertaine to the ſame Prince, though they are all ſervants of the Lord Jeſus, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they are more remote, and buſied about other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and things. O but now faith and love are choyce fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites that alwayes ſtand at the elbow of Chriſt, faith and love, are Chriſts greateſt favourites in Heaven. Now I ſay, a Chriſtian may grow rich in thoſe graces that are more remote from Chriſt, that are leſſe converſant about the perſon of Chriſt, when he doth not grow rich in thoſe particular graces that are moſt active about the perſon of Chriſt. He may grow rich in Humility, in Self-deniall, in Meekneſſe, in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when he doth not grow up in joy and delight,
<note place="margin">Some Limbs and branches of a Tree grow more then others.</note> and comfort, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Tree growes downward, when it doth not grow upward; ſo a ſoule may grow rich in ſome particular graces, when he doth not grow rich in other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; he may grow rich in thoſe graces that are more remote from Chriſt, when he doth not grow rich in thoſe graces that are more converſant about the perſon of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And ſo I have done with theſe Propoſitions, the ſerious minding of them may prevent many Objections, and to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny give ſatisfaction in ſeverall caſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>Cleerly, As there are few worldly rich men to thoſe that are poore, ſo there are few in this profeſſing Age, that will be found to be ſpiritually rich, compared with the multitude of <hi>Laodiceans</hi> that ſwarme in theſe times. We have many that ſay they are rich, and that think they are rich, when the truth is, they have either no grace, or but a very little grace: And theſe five fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing things doe clearly evidence it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>FIrſt, <hi>Rich men have more variety of objects to delight themſelves with, then poore men have.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They have Houſes, and Gardens, and Lands, and Cattell, and Silver, and Gold, and Jewels, and Pearls, and what not? to delight themſelves with. Oh but poore men have not ſuch variety of objects to delight themſelves with, as rich men have. It's juſt thus in ſpirituall riches. A man that's rich in grace, hath more variety of ſpirituall objects, about which his ſoule is moſt converſant, then a man that is poor in grace.

                  </note> He ha's more objects of love, of joy, of delight of content, to buſie and exerciſe his ſoule about, then others that are weak in grace. 2 <hi>Cor. 6. 10. Injoying nothing, and yet poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing all things.</hi> A ſoule rich in grace, poſſeſſes and injoyes all things in Chriſt, and Chriſt in all things. They injoy all good in him who is the chiefeſt good, who is the ſpring and fountaine of good.</p>
               <p>I have ſpoken largely to this already, and therefore ſhall content my ſelfe in giving you this hint. It ſtands you up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to inquire what variety of Objects you have to delight your ſoules in. But</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Rich men can reach to thoſe things that poore men cannot reach to.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would have ſuch and ſuch things, ſaith the poore man, as the rich man hath; I would fare as he fares, and weare as
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:168177:146"/> he wares, and doe as he does, but my ſtock will not reach it. So a ſoul that is ſpiritually rich can reach to thoſe things that one that is poore in grace cannot reach unto. He can reach to thoſe joyes, to thoſe comforts, and to thoſe contents, to thoſe heights of communion with God, and to thoſe Viſions and apprehenſions of God, that a ſoule that is not rich in grace, cannot reach to. Oh! I would faine have that comfort, and that joy, and that peace, and that communion with God, and thoſe Viſions of God, that ſuch and ſuch ſoules have, ſaith a poore Chriſtian, but I cannot, my ſtock will not reach to it. It's an Argument a man is growne higher, when he can reach higher then he could before, whether it be a beam, or a pin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So it's an Argument that a ſoule is grown rich in grace, when he can reach beyond what formerly he could reach unto; when he can reach beyond his inlargements, beyond his incomes, beyond his comforts, to a Chriſt: When in duty, he can reach above duty; when in an Ordinance, he can reach to Chriſt, above the Ordinance; when under inlargements, he can reach above inlargements, to Jeſus Chriſt. Oh but now a man that hath but a little grace, he can rarely reach above his duties, above Ordinances, above Inlargements, to Chriſt, he is very apt to <hi>ſit downe, and warm himſelfe with the ſparkes of his owne fire,</hi> and <hi>to feed upon</hi>

                  <hi>aſhes,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But now a ſoule that is rich in grace, ſayes, Well, theſe Ordinances are not Chriſt, theſe refreſhings are not Chriſt, theſe meltings are not Chriſt, theſe inlargements are not Chriſt, theſe are ſweet, but he is more ſweet; theſe are very precious, but he is moſt precious. And thou thoſe that are ſpiritually rich, doe out-reach all others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>When Taxes and burdens are laid upon poore men, they ſigh, and ſhrug, and complaine that they are not able to bear them, when rich men make nothing of them. So ſoules that are rich in grace, can bear burdens, without a burden; they can bear croſſes, afflictions, and perſecutions, with abundance of eaſe, cheerfullneſſe, and contentedneſſe of ſpirit; they doe
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:168177:146"/> not ſhrug, nor grumble, but beare the greateſt Trialls, with the greateſt ſweetneſſe, as you may ſee in <hi>Acts 5.

               <p>Hiſtory and Scripture ſpeaks out this, as well as our owne experience. The rich man above all others, is the greateſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of envy, and 'tis as true that ſuch that are moſt rich in

               <p>The next Uſe is this,</p>
               <q>If the Lord Jeſus Chriſt be ſo rich, then doe not joyne any
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Ʋſe 2."/> thing with him, in the great worke of your redemption, and ſalvation.</q>
               <p>There is riches enough in Chriſt to pay all your debts, and to ſatisfie Divine Juſtice to the utmoſt farthing, without being beholding to your prayers, teares, or humiliations:
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:168177:147"/> Chriſt will be <hi>Alexander,</hi> or <hi>Nemo,</hi> on earth. Kings love no conſorts, power is impatient of participation.</p>

               <p>Againe Thirdly,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If Chriſt be ſo rich, then take heed of three things.</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Ʋſe 3."/>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Take heed of ſitting downe dejected and diſcouraged under any loſſes or troubles that doe befall you, or that have or ſhall befall you for the name of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt is generally rich, he is able to make up all your loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and wants. <hi>Phil. 4. 19. But my God ſhall ſupply all your need, according to his riches in glory by Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> as he did the widowes veſſel. The fountaine hath not the leſſe water for the veſſel it fills; nor the Sun the leſſe light, for that it gives forth to the Starres; ſo the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath never a whit the leſſe for what he gives forth unto his Saints.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Zeliſlaus,</hi> the King of <hi>Poland's</hi> Generall, had loſt his hand in his ſervice, the King ſent him a golden hand. Ah Chriſtians! when you looſe this or that for him, he will ſend you a golden hand; if you looſe a penny for him, he will give you a Pearle. Chriſt will not live long in any mans
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:168177:148"/> debt, if he ſhould, he would looſe his glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>If the Lord Jeſus be very rich, Oh then take heed of deſpairing, by reaſon of your ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I confeſſe, the leaſt ſin ſhould humble the ſoule, but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the greateſt ſin ſhould never diſcourage the ſoule, much leſſe ſhould it work the ſoule to deſpaire. Read 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13, 14, 15. and deſpaire (I had almoſt ſaid) if thou can'ſt. Deſpairing <hi>Judas</hi> periſhed, when as the murderers of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Acts 2.</note> believing on Chriſt, were ſaved. Deſpaire is a ſin exceeding vild and contemptible, 'tis a word of eternall reproach, diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and confuſion; it declares the Devil a Conquerour, and what greater diſhonour can be done to Chriſt, then for
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>My ſin is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then can be forgiven,</hi> ſaith <hi>Gain.</hi> Thou lyeſt <hi>Cain,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auguſtine</hi> for Gods mercy is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the ſins of all men and its a great injury to God to diſtruſt of his mercy.</note> a ſoule to proclaime before all the world, the Devil a crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Conquerour? A deſpairing ſoule is <hi>Magor miſſabib, A terrour to himſelfe,</hi> his heart a hell of horrour, his conſcience an <hi>Acheldama,</hi> a field of black blood. He hath no reſt at home, nor abroad, at bed nor board, but is as if infernall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils followed him in fearfull ſhapes, terrifying and torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his perplexed ſoule. Eternity of miſery feared or felt, begets that Monſter, which, like <hi>Meduſas</hi> head, aſtoniſheth with its very aſpect, and ſtrangles hope, which is the breath of the ſoule. As it is ſaid, <hi>Dum ſpiro ſpero,</hi> ſo it may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted <hi>Dum ſpero ſpiro,</hi> other miſeries may wound the ſpirit, but deſpaire kills it dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>If Chriſt be ſo rich, Then take heed of preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chriſt is a Lyon, as well as a Lamb; he hath a ſword, as well as a Scepter.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Take heed of taking incouragement to ſin upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that Chriſt is rich in grace and mercy. To argue from the riches of mercy, to ſinfull liberty, is the Devils Logick. A ſoule that thus reaſons, is a ſoule left of God, a ſoule that is upon the laſt ſtep of the ladder, a ſoule that Satan hath by the hand, and the eternall God knowes whether he will lead him. What the women ſung of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>Saul</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 18. 6, 7. Rom. 6. 1, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>had ſlaine his thouſands, and David his ten thouſands,</hi> that I may ſay of deſpaire, and preſumption, <hi>Deſpaire hath ſlaine her thouſand, but preſumption hath ſlaine her ten thouſand. Shall we ſin that grace may abound? God forbid: How ſhall we that are dead to ſin, live any longer therein?</hi> As the beams
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:168177:148"/> of the Sun, ſhining on the fire, puts out the fire, ſo the ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of Gods mercy on us, ſhould extinguiſh ſin in us, as the Apoſtle argues, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15. from <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 2. 4. Chriſt ſeemes to ſay to ſoules, as <hi>Theſius</hi> ſaid once, <hi>Goe</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>and tell Creon, Theſius offers thee a gracious of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, yet I am pleaſed to be friends, if thou wilt ſubmit, this is my firſt Meſſage, but if this offer prevaile not, looke for me to be up in armes.</hi> Ah ſoules! if you ſhall abuſe the riches of grace, to a preſumptuous ſinning againſt Chriſt, Chriſt will take up Armes, and you ſhall dye for it.</p>
               <p>The next Uſe is this.</p>
               <q>If Chriſt be ſo rich, Oh then open to Chriſt when he
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Ʋſe 4."/> knocks.</q>
               <p>Chriſt knocks by his word, and he knocks by his rod; he knocks by his ſpirit, and he knocks by his meſſengers, and he knocks by conſcience, Oh open to him, for he is very rich. Though you ſhut the doore againſt a poore man, yet you will open it to one that is rich, and why not then to Chriſt, who would faine have entrance. <hi>Rev. 3. 20. Behold I ſtand at the doore, and knocke, if any man heare my voyce, and open the doore, I will come in to him, and will ſup with him, and he with me.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Behold, I ſtand.</hi> I that am the King of glory, I that am

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If any man will open.</hi> If the Maſter will not, yet if the ſervant will; if the Miſtriſſe will not, yet if the Maid will; if the Parent will not, yet if the Child will; if the rich man will not, yet if the poore man will; if the Phariſee won't, yet if the Publican will;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will come in, and will ſup with him, and he with me.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt hath the greateſt worth and wealth in him, as
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:168177:149"/> the worth and value of many peeces of ſilver, is in one piece of gold; ſo all the heavenly excellencies that are ſcattered abroad in Angels and men, are united to Chriſt; yea, all the whole volume of perfection, which is ſpread through heaven and earth, is epitomized in Chriſt.</p>

               <p>It was a notable ſaying of <hi>Jerome, If my father ſhould hang upon me, my brethren ſhould preſſe round about me, and my mother ſhould ſtand before me: I would throw downe my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I would break through my brethren, and I would tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon my mother, to come to Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Other Saints have lifted up Chriſt above all their Lands, relations, and lives, as you may ſee in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. and ſo did a multitude of the Martyrs under the ten perſecutions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As <hi>Pharoah</hi> ſet up <hi>Joſeph</hi> above all, and made him Governour of the Land. And as <hi>Darius</hi> ſet up <hi>Daniel</hi> over all, ſo you. muſt priſe Chriſt, and ſet up Chriſt above all.</p>
               <p>Remember a few things, that this may the better ſtick up on your hearts.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>A Chriſt highly prized, will be a Chriſt greatly delighted in.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Every ſoule delights in Chriſt, as he prizes Chriſt, and no otherwiſe. The reaſon of reaſons, why Chriſt is no more delighted in, is becauſe he is no more prized among the ſons of men. <hi>Cant. 2. 3. As the Apple-tree among the Trees of the wood, ſo is my well-beloved among the Sons: I ſate downe under his ſhadow with great delight, and his fruit was pleaſant to my taſt.</hi> The ſeeing of this object delights the eye of a believer; the hearing of this object delights the eare of a believer; the injoying, the poſſeſſing of this object, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights the heart of a believer. <hi>I ſate downe under his ſhadow with great delight.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="274" facs="tcp:168177:150"/>
               <p>The Apple-tree is delightfull for <hi>ſhadow,</hi> ſo is Chriſt. He is a ſhadow to poore ſoules when they are ſcorcht with trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles without, and terrours within. <hi>Iſa. 32. 2. And a man</hi> (that is, Chriſt) <hi>ſhall be as an hiding place from the wind, and as a covert from the tempeſt, as rivers of waters in a dry place, as the ſhadow of a great rock in a weary land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apple-tree is delightfull for <hi>pleaſantneſſe of fruit:</hi> So is the Lord Jeſus, for thoſe pleaſant fruites of righteouſneſſe and holineſſe that grow upon him.</p>
               <p>And the Apple-tree is delightfull for <hi>variets:</hi> So is Chriſt, for there are all varieties of excellencies in himſelfe. <hi>Col. 1. 19. It pleaſed the father that in him ſhould all full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe dwell.</hi> We delight in perſons and things, as we prize them, and no otherwiſe. <hi>Jonathan</hi> highly prized <hi>David,</hi> and delighted in him accordingly. <hi>Jacob</hi> highly prized <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell,</hi> and delighted in her anſwerably. You will delight in Chriſt as you prize him, if you prize him but a little, you will delight in him but a little, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, Remember this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Chriſt hghly prized, will be a Chriſt gloriouſly obeyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Every man obeyes Chriſt, as he priſeth Chriſt, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. The higher price any ſoule ſets upon Chriſt, the more noble will that ſoule be in his obedience to Chriſt. If Chriſt were more prized in the world, he would be more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed in the world. A ſoule that highly prizeth Chriſt, is

               <p>Againe, We prize things as they ſuite us; why, Chriſt is not onely a good, but a ſutable good. Chriſt is light to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten

               <p>Fourthly, Yet once more, that this may ſtick upon us, let us conſider, <hi>That where we are highly prized, there we highly prize.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt doth exceedingly prize every believing ſoule, yea, even ſuch poore weak Saints, that many ſwell'd ſoules ſlight, and deſpiſe, as perſons of no worth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they want that light and knowledge, and thoſe parts and gifts that others have.

He prizes you as his <hi>Diadem,</hi> Iſa. 62. 3. He prizes you as his <hi>Friends,</hi> John 14. He prizes you as his <hi>Brethren;</hi> Heb. 2. 11, 12.

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:168177:151"/> an invaluable price upon ſuch worthleſſe ſoules.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, and laſtly, conſider, <hi>That your high prizing of Chriſt will worke you to value the leaſt things of Chriſt above the greateſt worldly good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Twill make you value the leaſt nodd of Chriſt, the leaſt love-token from Chriſt, the leaſt good look from Chriſt, the leaſt good word from Chriſt, the leaſt truth of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> above all the honours, treaſures, pleaſures, and glories of this world. <hi>Pſal. 119. 72.

               <p>That is a very dreadfull Scripture, <hi>Jer. 17. 13. All you that forſake the Lord, ſhall come to be aſhamed, and they that depart from him, ſhall be written in the duſt.</hi> Can you read this Text, backſliding ſoules, and not tremble? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe,</p>
               <q>If the Lord Jeſus Chriſt be ſo rich, Oh then, all you that have an intereſt in him, labour mightily to clear up
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Ʋſe 9."/> your intereſt, and to be more and more confident of your intereſt in ſo rich a Jeſus.</q>
               <p>My Brethren, 'tis one thing for a man to have an intereſt in Chriſt, and another thing to have his intereſt cleer'd up to him. I doe ſpeak it with grief of heart, That even among ſuch Chriſtians that I hope to meet in Heaven, there's ſcarce one of forty, nay, one of a hundred, that is groundedly able to make out his intereſt in the Lord Jeſus. Moſt Chriſtians live between feare and hope, between doubting, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: One day they hope that all is well, and that all ſhall be well for ever; the next day they are ready to ſay, That
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:168177:153"/> they ſhall one day periſh by the hand of ſuch a corruption, or elſe by the hand of ſuch or ſuch a temptation: And thus they are up and downe, ſav'd and loſt, many times in a day.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay unto me,</p>
               <q>What Meanes ſhould we uſe to clear up our intereſt in
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Queſt."/> Chriſt.</q>
               <p>I'le tell you, there are ſix ſingular Means that you ſhould
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Anſw."/> labour after for the evidencing more and more your intereſt in Chriſt. And take it from experience, you will find that they will contribute very very much for the evidencing your intereſt in Chriſt. And the
<note place="margin">Means for the evidencing our intereſt in Chriſt.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt is this, <hi>Faithfully and conſtantly fall in with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Holineſſe is the intereſt of Chriſt, the Goſpel is the intereſt of Chriſt, the precious Ordinances are the intereſt of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now the more ſincerely and roundly you fall in with the intereſt of Chriſt, the more abundantly you will be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and perſwaded of your intereſt in Chriſt. Such ſoules
<note place="margin">The Primitive Chriſtians did generally fall in with the intereſt of Chriſt and they general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their intereſt in Chriſt.

               <p>Secondly, <hi>Be kind to the ſpirit of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doe not grieve him, doe not ſlight him. If you ſhould ſet this ſpirit a mourning, that alone can evidence your intereſt, that alone can ſeale up your intereſt in Chriſt, by whom ſhall your intereſt in Chriſt be ſealed up? O doe not grieve the ſpirit, by acting againſt light, againſt conſcience, againſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements; doe not grieve him by caſting his cordialls and comforts behind your backs; doe not grieve him by ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deſpiſing his gracious actings in others; doe not caſt water upon the ſpirit, but wiſely attend the hints, the Items and motions of the Spirit, and he will clear up thy intereſt in Chriſt, he will make thee ſay, <hi>My Beloved is mine, and I am his.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The more the ſoule is conformable to Chriſt, the more confident it will be of its intereſt in Chriſt. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 17.
<note place="margin">As all good Orators in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be like <hi>Demoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henes,</hi> ſo all good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be like to Jeſus Chriſt, for therein lyes their glory and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>

A more full conformity to Chriſt in heart and life, will make your lives a very Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Intereſt Chriſt in the glory of all you injoy, and in the glory of all you doe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a precious way to have your intereſt in Chriſt more
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 31.</note> and more evidenced to your owne ſoules. Such as are good at this, as are much in this, will find Chriſt every day a clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up more and more their intereſt in himſelfe. 'Tis not (uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally) long night with ſuch ſoules. O Chriſtians! intereſt Chriſt more and more in the glory of all your graces, intereſt him in the glory of all your duties, intereſt him in the glory of all your abilities, as Chriſt doth intereſt you in himſelfe, in
<note place="margin">John 1. 16. Rev. 1. 5, 6. 1 Pet. 2. 9.</note> his ſpirit, in his graces, in his riches, in his Titles, in his digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in his offices. Ah Chriſtians! did you intereſt Chriſt more in all you have, in all you are, and in all you doe, you would never be ſo full of feares, and doubts, and queſtions, about your intereſt in Chriſt, as you are. Your intereſſing of Chriſt in all you have and doe, will ſpeak out, not onely the

               <p>The Heathen Gods were contented to divide their honours amongſt themſelves, and hence the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> rejected Chriſt, from taking him to be a God, after that they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:168177:154"/> about it, <hi>For</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>if Chriſt come to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged a God, he will not ſhare with the reſt, he will have all himſelfe:</hi> And ſo upon this reaſon they refuſed him. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, Chriſt will not have any competitor, he will rather part with any thing, then with his glory. <hi>Iſa. 42. 8. I am the Lord, that is my name, and my glory will I not give to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, neither my praiſe to graven Images.</hi> Chriſt will rather part with his life, then with his honour; therefore let every Chriſtian ſay as <hi>David</hi> does 1 <hi>Chron. 29. 11, 12, 13. Thine O Lord, is the greatneſſe, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the Majeſty, for all that is in the Heaven, and in the earth, is thine: Thine is the Kingdome, O Lord, and thou art exalted as head above all: Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reigneſt over all: And in thine hand is power and might, and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give ſtrength unto all. Now therefore our God we thanke thee, and praiſe thy glorious name.</hi> And cleerly friends, the more your hearts are led forth to intereſt Chriſt in all you injoy, and in all you doe, the more clear and glorious evidence you will have of your intereſt in Chriſt; let his honour and glory lye nearer and nearer to your hearts, and you ſhall ſee that he ha's ſet you as a ſeale upon his arme, as a ſeale upon his heart.</p>
               <p>The fifth meanes to gaine the knowledge of your intereſt in Chriſt, is, <hi>By cleaving to Chriſt, and whatſoever is deare to Chriſt, in the face of all miſeries, difficulties, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It's nothing to cleave to Chriſt in faire weather, when eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<note place="margin">Pſal. 44. Acts 5. Heb. 11. Dan. 3. Acts 21. 13.</note> one cleaves to Chriſt, when every one profeſſes Chriſt; but to cleave to him in a ſtorme, when every one runs from him, this ſpeaks out a child-like diſpoſition, it ſpeaks out a <hi>Jacob's</hi> ſpirit. Surely he muſt needs have much of Chriſt, that nothing can take off from cleaving to Chriſt. When the ſoule ſayes to Chriſt, as <hi>Ruth</hi> ſaid to <hi>Naomi, Whither thou</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ruth 1. 15, 16, 17, 18.</note> 
                  <hi>goeſt, I will goe, and where thou lodgeſt, I will lodge, thy people ſhall be my people, and thy God ſhall be my God. The Lord doe ſo to me, and more alſo, if ought but death part thee and me.</hi> When neither the frownes of men, nor the reproach of
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:168177:154"/> men, nor the contempt of men, nor oppoſitions from men, can take the ſoule off from cleaving to Chriſt, it will not be long before Chriſt ſpeaks peace to ſuch a ſoule. <hi>Pſal. 63. 8. My ſoule followeth hard after thee, thy right hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds me.</hi> In the Hebrew 'tis, <hi>My ſoule cleaveth to thee,</hi> or
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dabka naphſhi.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>is glewed to thee,</hi> as <hi>Jonathan's</hi> ſoule cleav'd to <hi>David,</hi> and as <hi>Jacob's</hi> ſoule cleav'd to <hi>Rachel,</hi> in the face of all difficulties and troubles. Doubtleſſe, when the ſoule cleaves to Chriſt in the face of all afflictions and difficulties, this carries with it

In temporalls men cleave to perſons and things, as their intereſt is in them, and ſo 'tis in ſpirituals alſo. Chriſt cannot, Chriſt will not throw ſuch to hell, that hang about him, that cleave to him.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, and laſtly, <hi>If you would know whether you have an intereſt in Chriſt, Then be very much in obſerving what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt Chriſt ha's in you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſerve whether he ha's the intereſt of a head, a husband, a father, or no; Chriſt ha's a generall intereſt in all creatures, as he is the Creator and Preſerver of them: And he ha's a heads intereſt, a husbands intereſt, a fathers intereſt, onely in them that have a ſaving intereſt in him. The intereſt of the head, the husband, the father, is the greateſt intereſt, 'tis the ſweeteſt intereſt, 'tis a commanding intereſt, 'tis a growing intereſt, 'tis a peculiar intereſt, 'tis a laſting intereſt; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, if the Lord Jeſus hath ſuch an intereſt in you, you may be as confident that you have a reall and glorious intereſt in him' as you are confident that you live. And thus much for the means whereby you may come to know your intereſt in rich Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Before I cloſe up this diſcourſe, give me leave to ſpeak a few words to poore ſinners, who to this very day are afar off from this Jeſus, who is ſo rich in all excellencies and glories.

Oh doe not deale with your ſoules, when Chriſt is tendered and offered to you, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſimple people doe when they goe to Market, they might have a good penny-worth, but that they are loath to part with ſome old peece of gold, that ha's been given them by a father, or a friend; ſomewhat willing they are to have the good penny-worth, but unwilling they are to part with their gold. 'Tis ſo with many poore ſinners, when the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is preſented to their ſoules, as a very glorious pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny-worth, ſomewhat willing they are to have him, but unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling they are to part with their old gold, with ſome old ſweet darling luſt. But ſinners, don't you deceive your own ſoules, ſin and your ſoules muſt part, or Chriſt and your ſoules can never meet: Sin and your ſoules muſt be two, or Chriſt and your ſoules can never be one. Chriſt is a moſt precious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity,
<note place="margin">Prov 8. 11.</note> he is <hi>better then Rubies, or the moſt coſtly Pearles;</hi> and you muſt part with your old gold, with your ſhining gold, your old ſins, your moſt ſhining ſins, or you muſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh for ever. Chriſt is to be ſought and bought with any paines, at any price; we cannot buy this gold too deare. He
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:168177:155"/> is a Jewel more worth then a thouſand worlds, as all know that have him: Get him, and get all; miſſe him, and miſſe all.</p>
               <p>Now if ever you would get an intereſt in Chriſt, and ſo by gaining an Intereſt in him, be poſſeſt of all the riches and glory that come by him, then be ſure to get your hearts poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt with theſe nine Principles that follow.</p>
               <p>And the firſt is this,</p>
               <q>That the great end and deſigne of Chriſts coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, was the Salvation of ſinners.</q>
               <p>Get this Principle rooted in your ſpirits. <hi>I came not to call the righteous</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but ſinners to repentance.</hi> And
<note place="margin">Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. 9. 13. Mark 2. 17.</note> in 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 15. This is a faithfull ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Chriſt Jeſus came into the world to ſave ſinners.</hi> Chriſt layes aſide his Royal Crowne, he puts off his glorious Robe, he leaves his fathers boſome, he takes a journey from Heaven to Earth, and all to ſave poore loſt ſinners. That which Chriſt had moſt in his eye, and upon his heart in his coming into the world, was the ſalvation of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Lay up this truth, feed upon this Honey-comb.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Get this Principle rooted in your hearts. <hi>Viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>That none ever yet obtained an intereſt in Chriſt, but unworthy creatures.</q>
               <p>When you are preſſed to get an Intereſt in Chriſt, you are ready to ſay, O I am unworthy, <hi>Will Chriſt ever looke after ſuch a one as I am?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer. Yes. For this is a moſt certaine Principle, <hi>That none ever attain'd an intereſt in Chriſt, but unworthy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> Was <hi>Paul</hi> worthy before he had an intereſt in Chriſt? Wbat worthineſſe was in <hi>Mathew,</hi> when Chriſt call'd him from the Receipt of Cuſtome? And what worthineſſe was in <hi>Zacheus,</hi> when Chriſt call'd him downe from the <hi>Cycomore</hi> Tree, and told him, that <hi>This day ſalvation was come to his</hi>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:168177:156"/> 
                  <hi>houſe?</hi> Was <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> or <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> worthy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had an Intereſt in Chriſt? Surely no. Though you are unworthy, yet Chriſt is worthy: Though you have no merit, yet God ha's mercy: Though there is no ſalvation for you by the Law, yet there is ſalvation for you by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>
               <p>Againe, Chriſt requires no worthineſſe in any man before
<note place="margin">Such as ſhall goe to prove he does, muſt make a new Goſpel, a new Bible.</note> he believes, and he that won't believe before he is worthy, will never believe. If you look upon God with an Evangelical eye, you ſhall ſee that he that is moſt unworthy, is moſt capable of mercy. A real ſenſe of our owne unworthineſſe, renders us moſt fit for Divine mercy. This Objection, <hi>I am unworthy,</hi> is an unworthy Objection, and ſpeaks out much pride and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the Goſpel, and of the freeneſſe and riches of Gods grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Let this Principle dwell in you. <hi>Viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>That Chriſt hath loſt none of his affections to poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, by going to heaven.</q>
               <p>Oh! how did his bowels work towards ſinners, when he was on earth? And certainly they work as ſtrougly towards them now he is in heaven. His love, his heart, his good will is as much towards them as ever. Chriſt is <hi>Alpha,</hi> and <hi>Ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga,</hi>

               <p>Fourthly, Get this Principle riveted in your hearts,</p>

               <p>Seventhly, Get this Principle rooted in you,</p>
               <q>That it is the delight of Chriſt to give poore ſinners an intereſt in himſelfe.</q>
               <p>He is not onely able to doe it, but 'tis his delight to doe it. Chriſts ſoule is in nothing more; witneſſe his leaving his
<note place="margin">Chriſt did ſo much delight, and his heart was ſo much ſet upon the converſion &amp; ſalvation of the <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> That he neglected his owne body, to ſave their ſouls, as you may cleerly ſee in <hi>John</hi> 4. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </note> fathers boſome, witneſſe his laying downe his Crowne, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thoſe many ſufferings and deaths that he went through in this world: Witneſſe thoſe Goſpel acclamations, <hi>Mark 16. 16. Revel.</hi> 22. 17. Witneſſe thoſe perſwaſive exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and gracious impetrations and intreaties, <hi>Ezek. 33. 11. Mat. 11. 28. 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 20.

So in <hi>Pſal. 40. 7, 8. I delight to doe thy will, O my God, thy Law is in my heart.</hi> Or as the Hebrew hath it, <hi>'Tis in the midſt of my bowels.</hi> Now (mark) the will of the father was the ſalvation of ſinners: This was the will of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt ſhould ſeeke and ſave them that are loſt,</hi> Mat. 18. 11. Now ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I delight to doe thy will O my God.</hi> 'Tis the joy and rejoycing of my heart, to be a ſeeking, and a ſaving of loſt ſinners. When Chriſt was hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, he went not into a Victualling-houſe, but into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and taught the people moſt part of the day, to ſhew how much he delighted in the ſalvation of ſinners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eighthly, Get this Principle riveted in your hearts,</p>
               <q>That as there is nothing in Chriſt to diſcourage you
<note place="margin">Cant. 1. 3. The name of a Saviour is honey in the mouth, and muſick in the ear, and a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile in the heart, ſaith one.</note> from looking after an intereſt in him, ſo there is every thing in Chriſt that may incourage you to get an intereſt in him.</q>
               <p>Look upon his Name, <hi>Thy name is as an Ointment pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out, and therefore doe the Virgins love thee. The name of</hi>

                  <hi>Jeſus hath a thouſand treaſures of joy and comfort in it,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> and ſo hath all his other names. If you look upon Chriſt in his natures, in his offices, in his graces, in his beauties, in his gifts, and in his works, you will find nothing but what may incourage you to believe in him, and to reſigne up your ſelves to him. Ah poore ſinners! what would you have? Is there not power in Chriſt to ſupport you, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in Chriſt to pardon you, and grace in Chriſt to heal you, and goodneſſe in Chriſt to relieve you, and happineſſe in Chriſt to crowne you, and what would you have more? Oh that you would believe!</p>
               <p>Ninthly, Let this Principle be rooted in you,</p>
               <q>That the ſureſt way, and the ſhorteſt cut to mercy, and to get an intereſt in Chriſt, is by a peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory caſting of the ſoule (by faith) on Chriſt.

               <p>Now for the opening of the Point, I ſhall onely attempt two things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 Give you the Reaſons, <hi>Why it's the great Duty of Miniſters to preach Chriſt to the people.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2 (Which will be the maine) To ſhew you <hi>How they are to preach Chriſt to the people.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>I confeſſe this is a very uſefull Point in theſe dayes, wherein many men Preach any thing, yea, every thing but a crucified Jeſus. Well Chriſtians, remember this, As 'tis your duty to take heed <hi>how</hi> you heare, ſo 'tis as much your duty to take heed <hi>who</hi> you hear. Many there are that count and call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Miniſters of Chriſt, and yet have neither skill, nor will to Preach Jeſus Chriſt, to exalt and lift up Jeſus Chriſt in lip or life, in word or work, a ſad reckoning theſe will have to make up at laſt.</p>
               <p>But to come to the Reaſons of the Point, <hi>Why it is the great worke and duty of Miniſters to preach Jeſus Chriſt to the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe that this is the onely way to ſave, and to win ſoules to Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>There is no other way of winning and ſaving ſoules, but by the Preaching of Chriſt to the people. In <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 10, 11, 12. compared, <hi>Neither is there ſalvation in any other, for there is none other name under heaven given among men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi>

                  <hi>we muſt be ſaved.</hi> You may Preach this, and that, and a thouſand things to the people, and yet never better them, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver win them; 'tis onely Preaching of Chriſt, that allures and drawes ſoules to Chriſt. <hi>John 17. 3. This is life eternall, to know thee the onely true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> Ah! nothing melts the hearts of ſinners, nor wins upon the hearts of ſinners, like the Preaching of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. 'Tis true, the teaching of this, and that opinion, may pleaſe many a mans fanſie, but 'tis onely the Preaching of Chriſt that changes the heart, that conquers the heart, that turnes the heart, <hi>&amp;c. Peter</hi> by Preaching of a crucified Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Acts 2. 14. to 42.</note> converts three thouſand ſoules at once. Were Chriſt more Preached, men would be more inamoured with him. He is onely precious to them that hear of him, and that believe in
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:168177:159"/> him. Chriſt is in all reſpects incomparable, and therefore as
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 7.</note> you would honour him, and win upon others, make him more and more knowne to the world, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Secondly, They are to Preach Chriſt to the people, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the choyceſt and the chiefeſt way to ingratiate Chriſt with poore ſoules.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>This brings Chriſt and the ſoule together, and this keeps Chriſt and the ſoule together; nothing indeares Chriſt to

We ſee by wofull experience, Chriſt neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, deſpiſed, ſcorned, and trampled upon by moſt, and no wonder, for many Preach themſelves more then Chriſt, and they Preach men more then Chriſt, and their owne notions and impreſſions, more then Chriſt. Surely Chriſt is but little beholding to ſuch Miniſters, and I think the ſoules of men as little, and Oh that they were ſo wiſe as to conſider of it, and lay it to heart! Surely a reall Chriſtian cares not for any thing that hath not <hi>(Aliquid Chriſti) ſomething of Chriſt in it.</hi> There is a ſtrange and ſtrong Energy or forcibleneſſe in hearing Chriſt and his beauties and excellencies diſplayed and diſcovered.</p>
               <p>The daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by hearing the Church pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Chriſt in ſo high a Character, and by deſcribing and painting him out in ſuch lively colours, are ſo inchanted and inflamed, that, might they but know where to find him, they would be at any paines to ſeek him. When Chriſt is ſet forth in his glories, with much affection and admiration others fall in love with him, as you may ſee by comparing <hi>Cant. 5. 10.—ult.</hi> with <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 1.</p>

But how unlike to Chriſt, the Prophets, and Apoſtles, theſe dark Doctours are, I will leave you to judge; nor would I have their accounts to make up for all the world; I will leave them to ſtand or fall to their owne Maſter.

               <p>It is written of the <hi>Fox,</hi> that when he is very hungry af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter prey, and can find none, that he lyes downe, and feigneth himſelfe dead, and ſo the Fowles light upon him, and then he catcheth them. <hi>Paul</hi> hungring after the welfare of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> ſoules, makes uſe of his heavenly craft to catch them. There's a great deale of wiſedome required to hold out Chriſt unto the people, not onely as a good, but as the
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:168177:163"/> greateſt good, as the choyceſt good, as the chiefeſt good, as the moſt ſutable good, as an immutable good, as an indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant good, as a totall good, and as an eternall good. Chriſt muſt thus be held forth to draw ſouls to fall in love with him, and to work their hearts to run out after him. There's wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome required to anſwer all cavils and objections that keep Chriſt and poore ſoules aſunder. There's wiſedome required to take ſoules off from all falſe bottomes, that they are apt to built upon. There's wiſedome required to preſent Chriſt freely to ſoules, in oppoſition to all unrighteouſneſſe, and to all unworthineſſe in man. There's wiſedome required to ſuite things to the capacities and conditions of poore ſoules, to make dark things plaine, and hard things eaſie. Miniſters muſt not be like him in the Emblem; That gave ſtraw to the Dogge, and a bone to the Aſſe, but they muſt ſute all their diſcourſes to the conditions and capacities of poore creatures, or elſe all will be loſt, time loſt, paines loſt, God loſt, Heaven loſt, and ſoules loſt for ever.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, They muſt Preach Chriſt <hi>Zealouſly, boldly,</hi> as well as wiſely, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 20. when they had charged them that they ſhould Preach no more in the name of Chriſt, why? ſay they, what doe you tell us of the whip, or of Priſons, or of this and that, <hi>We cannot but ſpeake the things that we have ſeene and heard.</hi> So in <hi>Jer. 20. 9.

               <p>Eighthly, Miniſters muſt preach <hi>Feelingly, experimentally,</hi> as well as exemplarily; they muſt ſpeak from the heart, to the heart; they muſt feele the worth, the weight, the ſweet of thoſe things upon their owne ſoules, that they give out to others. 1 <hi>John 1. 1, 2, 3. That which was from the begining, which we have heard, which we have ſeene with our eyes, which we have locked upon, and our hands have handled of the word of life.

That which we have ſeene and heard, declare we unto you, that ye alſo may have fellowſhip with us; and truly our fellowſhip is with the father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The higheſt Myſtery in the Divine Rhetorick, is to feele what a man ſpeaks, and then ſpeak what a man feeles.</p>

Yea, for want of a Chriſt within, how little of Chriſt doe they underſtand? How little of Chriſt doe they make known, notwithſtanding all their borrowed helps? <hi>Paul</hi> was a man that had got a Chriſt within him, <hi>Gal. 2. 20.

                  <hi>All Scripture is given by inſpiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for inſtruction in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe: That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſhed unto all good workes.</hi> All Books and helps are not comparable to the Bible, for the compleating and perfecting of a man for the work of the Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>That which a Papiſt reports of their Sacrament of the Maſſe, <hi>That there are as many Myſteries in it, as there are drops in the ſea, duſt on the earth, Angels in heaven, Starres in the skie, Attomes in the Sun-beams, or ſands on the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The third and laſt Rule I ſhall lay downe, is this, Such as would Preach Chriſt aright to the people, had need</p>

               <p>The vanity of which doctrines may be thus diſcovered.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>They doe not diſcover ſin in its uglineſſe and filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as the Scriptures doe.</hi> They ſearch but to the skin, they reach not to the heart; they doe not doe as the Maſter did in <hi>Jonah's</hi> ſhip, when they were in a ſtorme.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Humane doctrines have no humbling power in</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Theſe things had need be ſeriouſly minded in theſe dayes, wherein <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

A man may ſtudy much, and labour much, and lay out much of his time and ſpirits about humane doctrines, and yet after all, be like to <hi>Pharoah's</hi> lean Kine. A man that ſtudies humane doctrines, doth but feed upon aſhes.</p>
               <pb n="313" facs="tcp:168177:169"/>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Humane doctrines cannot cure a wound in the conſcience.</hi> The diſeaſed woman ſpent all ſhe had upon Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians, but was not a penny the better. The remedy is too weak for the diſeaſe. Conſcience like <hi>Prometheus Vulture,</hi> will ſtill lye gnawing notwithſtanding all that ſuch doctrines can doe.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Humane doctrines are ſo far from inriching the ſoule, that they uſually impoveriſh the ſoule.</hi> They weaken the ſoule, they expoſe the ſoule to the greateſt wants, and to the greateſt weakneſſes; they play the Harlot with the ſoule, they impoveriſh it, and bring it to a morſel of bread. Who ſo poore in ſpirituall experiences, and heavenly injoyments, as ſuch that ſit under the droppings of humane doctrines?</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>Humane doctrines make men ſervants to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and corruptions of men.</hi> They make men <hi>pleaſers of men, rather then pleaſers of God:</hi> Yea, they make men ſet up themſelves and others, ſometimes in the roome of Chriſt, and ſometimes above Chriſt. I hope theſe few ſhort hints may prevaile with ſome to fall in with this counſel, that ſo they may the better Preach the Lord Jeſus to the people.</p>

               </head>
               <p>For the underſtanding of this Point, Premiſe with me, two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That by a Minister, I underſtand one that is qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified according to Goſpel Rules, and that is internally called by God, and externally called by the people of God, to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall Office.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond thing that I would have you Premiſe with me
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:168177:170"/> for the underſtanding of the Point, is this, <hi>That the common Apellation of thoſe that are ſet apart for the Preaching of the Goſpel, in the New Testament, is</hi> (DIAKONOI.) <hi>Ministers.</hi> So in 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 5. 2 Cor.</hi> 3. 6. &amp; <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 4. &amp; <hi>Chap. 11. 15. 23. 1 Tim.</hi> 4. 16. And in divers other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the word <hi>Minister</hi> is a Title of Office, ſervice, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, given frequently to the Preachers of the Goſpel. As for the names of <hi>Ambaſſadors, Stewards,</hi> and the like, wherewith they are often honoured, they are figurative, and given to them by alluſion onely.</p>
               <p>Theſe two things being Premiſed, we ſhall now proceed to the opening of the Point.</p>
               <p>And in the firſt place I ſhall prove, <hi>That the Office of a Minister is an honourable Office.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then in the ſecond place I ſhall ſhew you, <hi>What ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is due to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then in the third place I ſhall ſhew you, <hi>How you are to honour them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then in the laſt place, we ſhall bring home all by <hi>A word of Application.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſtians, Give me leave to tell you this by the way, That ſince the Goſpel hath ſhined in <hi>England,</hi> a godly, faithfull, painfull Miniſtry was never more ſubtily and vehemently ſtruck at by men that make a faire ſhew, and by men of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt opinions, and wicked lives. This Age affords many Church-Levellers, as well as State-Levellers. Some there be, that under that notion of Plucking up corrupt Miniſters, would pluck up by the very roots, the true Miniſtry: But God ha's, and will be ſtill too hard for ſuch men; if they will be Monſters, God will be ſure to be Maſter. His faithfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
<note place="margin">Revel. 2. 1.</note> are ſtars that he holds in his right hand, and men ſhall as ſoon pull the Sun out of the Firmament, as pull them out of the hand of God.</p>
               <p>Now conſidering that there is ſuch a ſpirit abroad in the world, I hope no ſober ſerious Chriſtians will be offended at my ſtanding up to vindicate the Honour of a godly faithfull Miniſtry. In order to which, I ſhall firſt prove that the Office of a Miniſter is honourable, and to me theſe following things ſpeak it out.</p>
               <pb n="316" facs="tcp:168177:171"/>
               <p>Firſt, The ſeverall <hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Titles</hi> that are given to them in Scripture, doth ſpeak them out to be honourable. They are called <hi>Fathers, Stewards, Ambaſſadours, Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers,</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> as you all know that know any thing of Scripture. To ſpend time to prove this, would be to light Candles to ſee the Sun at noon.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Their worke is honourable.</hi> Their whole work is about ſoules, about winning ſoules to Chriſt, and about build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoules up in Chriſt, and to theſe two heads, the main work of the Miniſtry may be reduced. The more noble the ſoule is,
<note place="margin">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to him by faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> the more honour 'tis to be buſied and exerciſed about it. <hi>Jam. 5. 20. Let him know, that he which converteth the ſinner from the errour of his way, ſhall ſave a ſoule from death, and ſhall hide a multitude of ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let him know:</hi> That is, let him take notice that an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and glorious work is done by him. The ſoule is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate work of God, the ſoule is the Image of God, the ſoule is capable of union and communion with God, the ſoule is more worth then a world, yea, then a thouſand worlds. Chriſt prayed for ſoules, and wrought Miracles for ſoules, and wept for ſoules, and left his fathers boſome for ſoules, and bled out his heart blood for ſoules, and is gone to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to make proviſion for ſoules, yea, he is now a making interceſſion for ſoules. All which ſpeaks out the excellency of their Office, whoſe whole work is about ſoules.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jewes</hi> ſay of <hi>Moſes</hi> his ſoule, <hi>That it was ſucked out of his mouth with a kiſſe.</hi> Soules are deare, and ſweet to God.</p>
               <p>A third thing that ſpeaks out this truth, is this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>They are fellow-labourers with God.</hi> They are Co-workers with God in the ſalvation of ſinners. And this is a mighty honour, to be a fellow-labourer with God, to be a co-worker with God, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 9. For we are labourers together with God.</hi> Who would not work hard with ſuch ſweet company? Who

                     </gap>. 5. 13. Mark 9. 49, 50.</note> would not affect, prize, love, and honour ſuch ſervice? Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are called the <hi>light</hi> and <hi>ſalt</hi> of the world, becauſe they inlighten blind ſoules, and ſeaſon unſavoury ſoules, and ſo ſave them from corruption and perdition. Oh! to be joyned in
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:168177:171"/> any work with God, is an honour beyond what I am able to expreſſe.</p>
               <p>The Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> accounted it a diminution of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſars</hi> dignity, to joyne any Conſuls with him for the better carrying on the Affaires of the State. Oh but our God doth not think it a diminution of his dignity, that even his poore deſpiſed ſervants ſhould be fellow-labourers, and co-workers with him in the ſalvation of ſoules.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>The honourable account that the Lord hath of them in this imployment,</hi> ſpeaks out this truth, <hi>That their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is honourable.</hi> In <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 41, 42. compared. <hi>He that</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Kings and Princes have their Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors in very high account, ſo ha's God his.</note> 
                  <hi>receiveth you, receiveth me; he that receiveth a Prophet in the name of a Prophet, ſhall receive a Prophets reward.</hi> And <hi>Luke 10. 16. He that receiveth you, receiveth me; and he that deſpiſes you, deſpiſes me.</hi> This honourable account God hath of all his faithfull ſervants in this imployment.</p>
               <p>The fifth thing that ſpeaks out this truth, is this, <hi>They ſerve an honourable Maſter.</hi> They ſerve him that is all ear to hear, all hand to puniſh, all power to protect, all wiſedome to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, all goodneſſe to relieve, and all mercy to pardon. They

Mark, abſtracts doe better expreſſe God, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes, and adjectives. God is being, bonity, beauty, power, wiſedome, juſtice, mercy, and love it ſelfe. <hi>God is love</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>in the very abſtract.</hi> God is one infinite perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in himſelfe, which is eminently and virtually all perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions

               <p>Sixthly, <hi>Their very worke and ſervice is honourable.</hi> Why elſe did the Apoſtle cry out, <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Their maine work is to treat with ſinners about eternity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> There is no ſuch Embaſſage in the world, as this is, in which they are imployed. <hi>Epheſ. 6. 19, 20. Pray for me, that I may make knowne the Myſtery of the Goſpel, for which I am an Ambaſſadour in bonds.</hi> Faithfull Miniſters doe repreſent

They ſhall ſhine as the Stars in the Firmament.</hi> You know Ambaſſadors have not prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments while they are abroad, but when they come home in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their owne Countrey, then their Princes prefer them, and put much honour upon them. So will God deale with his Ambaſſadors. 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 7, 8. I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith, henceforth there</hi>

                  <hi>and in them that periſh.</hi> Miniſters ſhall be rewarded accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their faithfulneſſe and diligence, though ſome periſh. It ſhall be with them, as with Vine-dreſſers, you know Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſers are rewarded according to their diligence and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, though ſome Vines never bear, nor bring forth fruit at all. As Miniſters are diligent and faithfull, ſo the reward, the Crowne ſhall be given full at laſt. You know the Barber is as much rewarded for trimming a Black-a-more, though all his paines in rubbing him can never make him white, as he is for trimming and rubbing of another man that is white, and by a little paines is made more white. This is many-a-faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſters grief, that he takes a great deale of paines in rubbing and waſhing (as it were) to make ſoules white and clean, pure and holy, and yet they remaine after all, as black as hell; but ſurely their reward ſhall be never the leſſe with
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:168177:172"/> God. The Nurſe looks not for her wages from the Child, but from the Parent. If Miniſters, like clouds, ſweat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to death, that ſoules may be brought to life, great will be their reward, though thoſe ſoules ſhould periſh for ever, for whom they have wept, ſweat, and bled.</p>
               <p>God won't deale by faithfull Miniſters, as <hi>Exerxes</hi> did by his Steer-man, who crowned him in the morning, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed him in the evening of the ſame day: No, God will ſet an everlaſting Crowne upon their heads, who remaine la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious and faithfull to the death. The world for all their paines will Crowne them with thornes, but God at laſt will Crowne them with glory, he will ſet a Crowne of pure gold upon their heads for ever.

               <p>The <hi>Gretians</hi> uſe to give farre greater reſpect and honour
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:168177:173"/> to their Philoſophers, then to their Orators, becauſe that their Orators did onely teach them to ſpeak well, but their
<note place="margin">Harveſt-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boures have meat and drink, and double wages. Some think that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Law of the firſt borne, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 17. in which a two ſold por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be given him. The antient Chriſtians, as appears by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> were wont in their <hi>Agapes,</hi> or Love-feaſts to give their Miniſters a double porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Surely Miniſters ſhould have ſuch a liberal, honourable, and ingenious maintenance, as might ſet them above the vulgar, as the firſt-born by their dou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble portion were ſet up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the reſt of their Brethren.</note> Philoſophers did teach them to live well. Oh! what honour then is due to them that doe teach you both to ſpeak well, and to live well; both how to be happy here, and how to be bleſſed hereafter. And thus you ſee that honourable <hi>Countenance</hi> is due to faithfull Miniſters.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is an honour of <hi>Maintenance,</hi> as well as an honour of <hi>Countenance</hi> that is due to them, 1 <hi>Tim. 5. 17, 18. Let the Elders that rule well be accounted worthy of double honour, eſpecially they who labour in the word and doctrine. For the Scripture ſaith, Thou ſhalt not muzzle the Ox that treadeth out the Corne, and the labourer is worthy of his reward.</hi> It was not the manner in the Eaſtern Countreys to thraſh out Corne as we doe, but their Oxen trod it out, to which the Apoſtle allegorically compares laborious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours, who after a ſort cruſh out that Corne of which the bread of life is made, <hi>Gal. 6. 6. Let him that is taught in the word, communicate to him that teacheth in all good things. Be not deceived, God is not mocked, for what a man ſoweth, that ſhall he alſo reap.</hi> So in 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Who goeth a warfare any time at his owne charge? Who planteth a Vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? Or who feedeth a flocke, and eateth not of the milke of the flocke? Say I theſe things as a man? Or ſaith not the Law the ſame alſo? For it is written in the Law of Moſes, Thou ſhalt not muzzle the mouth of the Ox that treadeth out the Corne. Doth God take care for Oxen? Or ſaith he it altogether for our ſakes? For our ſakes no doubt this is written, that he that ploweth ſhould plow in hope, and that he that threſheth in hope ſhould be partaker of his hope. If we have ſowne unto you ſpirituall things, is it a great thing if we ſhall reap your carnall things?</hi> Mat. 10. 9, 10. <hi>Provide neither gold, nor ſilver, nor braſſe, in your purſes, nor ſcrip for your journey, neither two coates, neither ſhoes, nor yet ſtaves, for the workman is worthy of his meat.</hi> Gods appointment in all theſe Texts, beſpeak it.</p>
               <p>Againe, You may conſider the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of it; how ſhall they goe on in their warfare, if they be troubled with the
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:168177:174"/> things of this life. Againe, they are to give them ſelves <hi>wholly</hi> to the work of the Miniſtry, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 5. And againe, the <hi>equity</hi> and <hi>juſtice</hi> of the duty Chriſt and the Apoſtle ſhewes in the fore-named Scriptures, <hi>Mat. 10. 10. 1 Cor.</hi> 9. 10. The maintenance of the Miniſter ſhould be ſo free, and ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall, as may teſtifie that you honour him in your hearts, and as may keep him from contempt and ſcorne in the world. There are multitudes that grumble at the expence of a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for the maintenance of thoſe Divine Candles that waſte themſelves to give light to them; that will rather dye to ſave Charges, then ſpend a little money to ſave their lives, yea, their ſoules. They like well of Religion without expence, in <hi>Baſil,</hi> and a Goſpel without charge, but if it grow coſtly, 'tis none of their money. The Scripture ſayes, <hi>Buy the truth, but ſell it not;</hi> you can never over buy it, whatſoever you give for it; you can never ſufficiently ſell it, if you had all the world in exchange for it.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid of <hi>Caeſar, That he had greater care of his Bookes, then of his Royall Robes;</hi> for ſwimming thorow the water to eſcape his Enemies, he carryed his Books in his hand above
<note place="margin">The Miniſters maintenance is not to be eſteemed of the nature of Alms (as ſome would have it) but is a Tribute of honour, ſuch as is given by an inferiour, to his ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</note> the water, but loſt his Robes. But alaſſe! what are <hi>Caeſars</hi> Books to Gods Book? The word is the field, and Chriſt is the Treaſure that is hid in that field. The word is a ring of gold, and Chriſt is the Pearle in that ring of gold, and is it then worth nothing? Many deale with faithfull, painfull Miniſters, as Carriers doe with their Horſes, they lay heavy burdens upon them, and exact work enough, and give them but eaſie Commons, and then to recompence this, they hang Bels at their eares and necks. They ſhall be commended and applauded for brave excellent Preachers, and for great paines-takers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That maintenance that is juſtly due to the Miniſters of the Goſpel, is honourable, it ought to be ſutable to their condition and dignity: The maintenance that is due to them, is of the ſame nature with that which is given to Princes and Magiſtrates, by thoſe which are under them, and not a common maintenance which ſuperiours give to their inferiours, or ſervants.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There is an honour of <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Service</hi>
                  <pb n="323" facs="tcp:168177:174"/> that is due to them. And indeed, of all honours this is the greateſt honour that can be caſt upon a faithfull Miniſter, the honour of <hi>Obedience,</hi> Heb. 13. 7. <hi>Remember them that have the rule over you, who have ſpoken to you in the word of God.</hi> And <hi>verſ. 17. Obey them that rule over you.</hi> O ſubmit your ſelves, for they watch for your ſoules as they that muſt give an account, <hi>that they may doe it with joy, and not with grief, for that is unprofitable for you.</hi>

So in 2 <hi>Theſſ. 3. 14.

Ah Chriſtians! by your ſubmiſſion to their doctrine, you highly honour them, and you make their heavy task to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and ſweet unto them. Chriſtians, it will be your honour and happineſſe in the day of Chriſt, that you have liv'd out what they have made out to you.

The obedience and fruitfulneſſe of the people, is the Miniſters teſtimoniall, as the profiting of the Scholar is the Maſters commendations. Oh what an honour is it to a Miniſter, when it ſhall be ſaid of him, as one ſaid

               <p>Thirdly, You ſhould honour them <hi>By being followers of them, ſo far as they are followers of Chriſt.</hi> So in 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 16. Be ye followers of me, even as I am of Chriſt.</hi> Chap. 11. 11.

                  <hi>Alexander</hi> had ſomewhat a rye neck, and his Souldiers thought it an honour to be like him. Oh! 'tis an honour to Miniſters, when their people are like them in knowledge, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, love, humility, holineſſe.</p>

               <p>Fourthly, You muſt honour them <hi>By bearing them upon your hearts, when you appeare before the Lord in the mount. Epheſ. 6. 18, 19. 2 Theſſ. 3. 1, 2. 1 Theſſ. 5. 25. Col. 1. 4. 3. Heb. 13. 18. Acts</hi> 12. 5. All theſe Scriptures doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeak Chriſtians to bear their faithfull Miniſters upon their hearts when they are a wreſtling with God. None uſually are oppoſed, as they; their wants are many, their weakneſſes are more, their work is great, their ſtrength is ſmall. O pray, pray more and more for them, yea, pray believingly, pray af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately, pray fervently, pray unweariedly, that they may ſpeak from the heart, to the heart, that they may ſpeak
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:168177:176"/> things that are ſeaſonable and ſutable to the capacities and conditions of his people. They can tell when they want your prayers, and when they enjoy your prayers; did you pray more for them, they might doe more for your internall, and eternall good, then now they doe.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, You muſt honour them <hi>By adhering to them, and biding with them in all their tryals, afflictions, and tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that doe or ſhall attend them.</hi> 'Tis brave to owne them in a ſtorme, to owne them when others diſowne them, when others oppoſe them, and act highly againſt them. <hi>Paul</hi> lookt upon himſelf as much honored by <hi>Oneſiphorus</hi> owning of him in his chains, 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 16. The Lord give mercy unto the houſe</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>of Oneſiphorus, for he oft refreſhed me, and was not aſhamed of my chaine: But when he was in Rome, he ſought me out very diligently, and found me. The Lord grant unto him, that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day. And in how many things he miniſtred unto me at Epheſus, thou knoweſt very well. Chryſostome</hi> in an Oration, ſayes of Chriſtians, <hi>That they would not be kept from viſiting the Confeſſors in Priſon, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was forbidden with many threatning terrours, and it was great danger to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to draw to a cloſe, You have heard that the Office of a faithfull Miniſter is honourable, and you have heard what honour is due unto them, Let me therefore deſire you all <hi>To take heed of ſcorning, contemning, and deſpiſing thoſe that are faithfull, that are qualified according to Goſpel Rules.</hi>

               <p>That's a ſad word, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 15, 16, 17, 18. God ſent his Meſſengers early and late to reclaime them, but they mocked the Meſſengers of God, and deſpiſed his words, and miſuſed his Prophets, untill the wrath of the Lord aroſe againſt his people, till there was no remedy, nor no healing. <hi>David</hi> never plaid ſuch a harſh part all his dayes, as he did to the <hi>Ammonites</hi> that diſpitefully uſed his Ambaſſadours, as you may ſee at large in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.

               <p>The <hi>Romanes</hi> ſacked the famous City of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and razed it to the ground, for a little diſcourteſie they offered to their Ambaſſadours. And they ſlew many of the <hi>Illyrians,</hi> and the <hi>Tarentines,</hi> for miſuſing of their Ambaſſadours. And doe
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:168177:176"/> you think that the Lord is not as tender of the credite and honour of his faithfull Miniſters, and that he will not avenge the affronts, wrongs and injuries that are done unto them? Surely he will. <hi>Jer. 29. 17, 18, 19. Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, Behold I will ſend unto them the Sword, the Famine, and the Peſtilence, and will make them like vile Figgs that cannot be eaten, they are ſo evill. And I will perſecute them, with the ſword, with the famine, and with the Peſtilence: And I will deliver them to be removed to all the Kingdomes of the earth, to be a curſe, and aſtoniſhment, and an hiſſing, and a reproach among all Nations, whither I have driven them.</hi> But why will God doe this? <hi>Becauſe they have not hearkened</hi>

                  <hi>to my word, ſaith the Lord, which I ſent unto them by my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants the Prophets, riſing up early and ſending them, but ye would not heare, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Now mark, though theſe temporal judgements are not viſible among us, yet ſpirituall judgements, which are the worſt of judgements, are very viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Though there be no ſword, no famine, no Peſtilence, yet there is ſpirituall madneſſe, ſpirituall drunkenneſſe, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall giddineſſe. Oh! the blind minds, the corrupt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the hard hearts, the ſeired conſciences, that are to be found among the Profeſſors of this age! As there are no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<note place="margin">Jer. 13. 13. Ezek. 23. 33. 1 Tim. 4. 2. Tit. 1. 15.</note> to ſpirituall mercies, ſo there are no judgements to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall judgements. Oh the ſlightneſſe, the coldneſſe, the deadneſſe, the barrenneſſe that is abroad in the world! God ſuites his judgements to mens ſins, the greateſt ſins are alwayes attended with the greateſt judgements. In theſe dayes men ſin againſt more glorious means, more great love, more clear light, more tender bowels of mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then formerly, and therefore God gives men up to more ſad and dreadfull (ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall) judgements, then formerly.</p>
               <p>They ſay when <hi>Hercules</hi> drew up <hi>Cerberus</hi> from hell, he led him in a Chaine, and he went quietly till he came to the Horizon, and ſaw the peeping of the light, but then he pulled ſo ſtrongly, that he had like to have pulled the Conquerour and all back againe. Ah! 'tis ſad when men had rather live in darkneſſe, and dye in darkneſſe, and to hell in darkneſſe, then they will ſee the light, injoy the light, and walk in the
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:168177:177"/> light. Many fret at the light, and at thoſe that bring it, as the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> once a year ſolemnly curſe the Sun. Such ſoules ſtand in much need of pity, and prayer.</p>
               <p>And thus (according to my weak meaſure) I have given out what God ha's given in from this Scripture, and ſhall follow it with my prayers, that it may be a word of life and power, both to Writer, Reader, and Hearer. <hi>Amen.</hi>
